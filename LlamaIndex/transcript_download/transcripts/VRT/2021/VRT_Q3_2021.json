Joining me today are Burton Executive Chairman David Cote, Chief Executive Officer Rob Johnson, Chief Financial Officer, David Fallon, and Chief Strategy and Development Officer Gary Niederpruem. Before we begin, I'd point out that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events, including the future financial and operating performance of burdens. These forward-looking statements are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the cautionary language included in today's earnings release, and you can learn more about these risks in our registration statement, our proxy statement, and other filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date, we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will also present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release and in the investor slide deck found on our website @investors. vertiv.com.

                "text": "I and the Vertiv's team are disappointed and embarrassed by our second half, '21 and projected first-half '22 financial performance. We got behind on the inflation recovery curve with insufficient price and stayed there all year. The past few months Rob and his team have implemented price increases that we expect will generate $360 million year-over-year price versus $260 million incremental inflation. Generating $100 million of favorable price costs for the full-year '22, because much of that price is in the backlog it takes. Several months for the increases show in the financials. And, the vast difference between our expected first half and second half '22 performances. Our unimpressive financial performance was exacerbated by continued supply chain issues, which don't show much sign of abating at this point. Like everyone else out there will hopefully be issued lessons in the second half, but we are counting on much less [Indiscernible]. On the past side our orders were through the roof and 4Q with total company orders up 51% in the Americas up a 114% in the first quarter is off to a good start, even with the price increases. Our short-term performance, including anticipated first half '22 results is unimpressive. Our expected long-term performance starting in the second half of 2022 will be quite impressive. We getting heads finally, on price inflation recovery. Our orders are off the charts and market-leading, supply chain should loose them. We have favorably resolved the tax receivable agreement in two lawsuits, and the product ramp up is just beginning. Some of you may be wondering why I don't get more involved. The answer is, I have. And that's why you see much more aggressive inflation forecasting, price implementation, and other fixes that Rob will talk about. The management is readily accepted and implemented the let's say, suggestions and will deliver as presented. I apologize for putting all our investors during this. That being said, if restructuring this year that should turn around in the second half, the long-term thesis is very intact, especially as performance begins in the second half, if you take the second half run rate into 2023, you can see how intact that thesis is. We know we have to prove it to you, and we will. So with that, I will turn the call over to Rob."

                "text": "Thank you, Dave, the management team and I share the year sentiment about our Q4 results and the outlook for the first half of 2022. But before diving into the key messages on the first slide, let me comment on two topics. First, while Dave has been a good mentor to me over the last two years, our relationship is certainly evolved over the past 60 to 90 days. As is opening comments suggests, he has become much more actively involved in the day-to-day aspects of the business, both on the cost and price side, he is helping me almost daily basis to conduct reviews with our teams and host other business topics. And is my full expectation that this level of involvement will continue through 2022. Secondly, let me address our guidance miss in the fourth quarter for which I take full Responsibility for. In short, we screwed up and some of you undoubtedly are wondering how we could get so surprised. We significantly underestimated the magnitude of the material and freight inflation in the fourth quarter forecast mostly in America, by approximately $36 million. This underestimation cost also contributed to our underpricing in the market in 2021. So it was a huge deal not only for costs, but also price. Half of the inflation miss was related to unforeseen supplier de -commits on critical components and our need to execute spot buys and premium freight to meet customer commitments. The other half is related to forecasting issue within America's region, heavily influenced by our ERP implementation. But also, due to forecasting process issues within the region. These regional costs, forecasting issues have been fixed, and we feel very confident with our cost projections for 2022 as evidenced by our January costs being lower than what we were planning. And that is why we're comfortable with what we have that we have it all carryout. In addition, based upon better understanding of our underlying cost, we have been extremely aggressive with pricing than last 90 days or so. As you will see in today's presentation. To more than offset the higher costs. With this, better understanding of cost and higher pricing, which we're seeing in our year-to-date orders. We're confident that we will deliver strong financial results in the second half of 2022 and beyond. Now, turning to the key messages, on-demand, Vertiv products and services is very strong. Our organic sales were up 4% from Q4 of 2020. The strength of our position in the market can be validated by our order rate, which was up over 50% in Q4 over last year. And has pushed the total Vertiv's backlog to over $3.2 billion. Two, profitability challenge primarily driven because of inflationary headwinds, not because of a flawed strategy, or a decreasing demand for our products and services, but due specifically to inflation, that companies everywhere are battling. our fourth quarter adjusted operating profit was $94 million, which unfortunate was $58 million lower than last year's fourth quarter. We felt inflationary pressures most severely in Americas, but also across our other regions. Our pricing actions increased as the year went on, but they were exceeded by inflationary costs and created $135 million net headwind. We continue to raise price at aggressive rate even as recently as last month, and we will continue to do so to make sure we get ahead of inflation. As you know, and fortunately, we are carrying a large backlog and it takes quarters for that pricing to be fully realized. Fourth, we don't see the full impact of our pricing actions in the first half of 2022 but those actions will kick in during the second half and we expect the second half adjusted operating profit to be approximately $455 million, $230 million over the second half of 2021. Supply chain issues are real and challenging, delaying product completion. The verdict team is battling parts on a daily basis. Our biggest challenge is with electro -mechanical parts and fans. Critical components of many of our verdict products. Internally, we have launched counter measures to address the shortages. However, we expect and have been prepared for supply chain pressures to continue for the majority of 2022. Final and most important key message, although 2021 did not produce the results we expected for reasons I just shared. Vertiv is now well-positioned for strong performance in the second half of 2022 and into 2023 due to our aggressive pricing actions in Q4 and early 2022. Turning to Slide 4, recapping our 2021 performance, and then I'll provide some additional detail, what's playing out for 2022. With regard to 2021, we continue to have strong demand for our products. Some of this demand is because we are in a strong growing market. Some is because we are winning with our go-to-market strategies, and some is a result of our Vertiv product development efforts. These three reasons are giving us an order rate that's almost up 30% year-over-year and over 50%, as I mentioned earlier, in fourth quarter. Admittedly, we believe the significant order growth rate in quarter four is an indicator that we could have priced even more aggressively. And adding further confidence that our pricing actions over the next several months are appropriate, and will be received in the market. But a good portion of our $3.2 billion backlog will ship in 2022. Right now, we're getting visibility in the customer plans for 2023 and beyond. This visibility is being provided in the form of forecast, purchase orders providing us greater visibility to our revenue profile. Not only over the next several quarters, but into the future. On the 2021 supply side, we fully expect to be challenged for most of the year. Critical parts availability is spotty and despite all the efforts to qualify second and third sources and redesigned products where possible. We know part shortages or something our industry will grapple with throughout the year. In addition, 2021 inflation got ahead of our pricing just when we thought we had budgeted enough price, inflation got worse. This happened several times. We have corrected it now and are being very conservative in our expectations that inflation will not go away in 2022. The acquisition of ENI closed in November. Integration efforts are in full swing. We remain more confident than ever in our purchase decision. Vertiv will reap the benefits from this complementary nature of ENI's process and products and its ability to be accretive platform from Vertiv's long into the future. And 2021, we invested significantly in ERD just as we planned, we launched several new and innovative products and evidenced by their order rates, these products have exceeded expectations of our acceptance from the market, allowing us to take share in certain categories. In 2021 we invested in ERD of fundamental part of our long-term growth strategy. Now as we turn to 2022 outlook. Our demand environment remained strong, but deliveries remain constrained by part shortages, especially in the semiconductors and electro -mechanical parts that I discussed earlier. We aren't planning to see meaningful improvement in the supply chain this year. We have new production capacity coming online in America's to support our growing thermal business. We are anticipating material and freight costs will continue to increase, but our incremental pricing actions are expected to materially offset 2021 and 2022 inflation by the end of 2022. Pricing realization accelerates throughout '20 to '22 and provide a net price cost tailwind by Q3. We expect profit in the first half of 2022 will remain challenged, but will market re-improve in the second half of the year as price cost turns positive. Due to the pricing actions already initiated, we expect to exit 2022 in a good position. Turning to Slide 5, this is the chart we used to illustrate what we're seeing in the market in each of our regions and each of our end markets. And the cloud and hyper scale markets, they remained strong, represented by Green Buttons in America and EMEA. In APAC however, we see some slowdown as China is pushing cloud and hyper scale companies to maximize our existing facilities. We expect this to be a short-term phenomenon. When looking at our collocation customers, we're not only seeing strength across the regions, but increasing strength in Americas and EMEA. Tier-1, Tier-2, and Tier-3 colors are building out data centers to serve their customers. And we are participating in a very healthy way with the building out efforts. Our enterprise, small and medium business markets remained constant for Q4 to Q1. we're experiencing good performance in each region. The pipeline is growing and America is leading the way. The communication network market remains consistently strong with an uptick in Americas as 5G deployment continue to accelerate. The commercial industrial market, things remain a consistent in EMEA and APAC. And we did see an uptick in Americas allowing us to upgrade Americas from yellow to green. While the commercial and industrial market is a smaller slice of our business, the variety of products and services we sell in this market continues to grow. Moving to Slide 6, we closed the E&I acquisition on November 1st, and the integration team has been hard at work ever since. E&I has also faced, and is facing supply constraints and inflation, which is temporarily affected the top and bottom line. E&I has a very healthy backlog. We believe the pricing actions that we've taken in Q4 and will continue to be taken as needed, will be realized in the back half of '22 with E&I as well. We anticipate 2022 revenue from E&I alone to come in around $470 million with an adjusted operating profit of $80 million. Customer reactions to the deal have been nothing short of fantastic. And this acquisition has increased our relevancy with our customers. We expect as 2022 progresses, the synergistic leverage we will get from ENI will enhance our performance in 2023 and beyond. So I might summarize ENI in 2022 as a tough year, but still a great deal. Now I will turn it over to David to walk through the financials. David."

                "text": "Thanks, Rob. First turning to Slide 7. This slide summarizes our fourth quarter financial results, which certainly felt short of our external guidance across most of these financial metrics versus last year sales were up a $105 million or 8%, 4% organic when adjusted for the $67 million of sales from E&I and we also had a $13 million foreign exchange headwind. Our fourth quarter top-line, as Rob mentioned, continued to be negatively affected by challenges with procuring parts. As the underlying market demand certainly was much stronger than implied in this year-over-year sales growth, with orders up over 50% compared to last year's fourth quarter. And it's definitely seen with our record high backlog at year-end Without the supply chain constraints and this is a little bit hypothetical, conceptual, our sales growth percentage would have easily been in the double-digits for the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating profit of $94 million fell significantly short of our external guide, and it was primarily driven, if not entirely, by contribution margin, which will summarize in a separate slide in a short bit. On this slide, we captured the drivers of the $58 million reduction in adjusted operating profit from last year's fourth quarter, including $80 million lower contribution margin, which was primarily driven by a $60 million headwind from price cost. Approximately $90 million of material and freight inflation only partially offset by $30 million of incremental pricing. And of note that our pricing was actually relatively consistent with our external guide. As we will discuss with 2022 guidance, we've addressed the $60 million fourth quarter and $135 -- the $60 million fourth quarter, $135 million full-year 2021 price cost and balanced with aggressive price actions taken in the fourth quarter and early 2022. Returning the fourth quarter adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS drop consistent with the adjusted operating profit decline. With adjusted operating margin about 500 basis points lower and adjusted EPS about $0.25 lower than last year's fourth quarter. And finally on this page, fourth-quarter free cash flow was significantly lower than prior year, primarily driven by the lower adjusted operating profit. But also timing of working capital, and about $30 million of cash M&A expenses. Turning to Page 8, this slide summarizes our fourth-quarter segment results. The Americas region continues to be more impacted by supply chain challenges than the other two regions. The supply chain challenges negatively affected both America's top and bottom line. With organic net sales up just $7 million or around 1% against a very strong regional market demand backdrop where orders were more than two times last year's fourth quarter. The left-hand chart at the bottom of the page shows the $69 million year-over-year decline in adjusted operating profit in the Americas. Of course, heavily influenced by price cost. Approximately 70% to 75% of the overall [Indiscernible] price cost headwind for 2021, and in the fourth quarter is in the Americas despite the Americas representing less than 45% of total sales. Freight inflation was particularly acute in the fourth-quarter and accelerated significantly in the U.S. as we progress through the end of the year. Of course, in response to disproportionate net inflation in the Americas, our fourth quarter and 2022 pricing responses have also been much stronger in that region. All things considered APAC posted relatively good results in the fourth quarter with organic sales up almost 3% and adjusted operating profit and margin relatively flat with last year, although not completely immune from the current supply chain, challenges, relatively little of our 2021 net price cost headwind came from APAC. And finally on this slide, moving to the right EMEA showed strong fourth quarter top-line growth with organic sales up 11% however, margins were down about a 130 basis points from last year as the leverage benefit from these higher sales was more than offset by a price cost headwind. Next, turning to Slide 9. This chart bridges fourth quarter adjusted operating profit from our $176 million guidance to the $94 million actual and $82 million negative variance. $46 million of this variance was due to higher-than-expected material freight and labor inflation primarily in the America and especially concentrated on freight, including premium freight for both inbound and outbound shipments to protect customer deliveries, but also due to an increase in standard over the road rates, which were up over 30% from last year's fourth quarter. As we will discuss shortly, our 2022 guidance assumes that these fourth-quarter inflationary headwinds continue and trend even higher in 2022, moving to the right, we incurred approximately $10 million more than an expected sales commission expense in the fourth quarter, primarily due to strong fourth quarter orders up over 50% from last year's fourth quarter. E&I, as Rob mentioned, came in short of expectations in the fourth quarter and volume for overall Vertiv's -- base Vertiv was lower than expected due to the parts availability that we discussed. And finally, on this page, pricing was materially in line with our fourth quarter expectations off about $2 million, but they approximately $53 million that pricing we realized in 2021 has been sticking. And as we will review in a few moments, it is expected to accelerate significantly as we progress through 2022. Next, turning to Slide 10, this page summarizes our full-year 2021 results versus prior year. We won't spend a lot of time on this slide as I'm sure everyone is anxious to understand what we see going forward in 2022, but to summarize 2021, despite the supply chain constraints, we grew our top-line organically by about 11%, which likely would've been over 15% without the supply challenges. Our adjusted operating profit and margin were significantly affected by negative net price costs with almost $190 million of material and freight inflation, only partially offset by $53 million of pricing. Although more aggressive pricing actions were taken at the end of 2021 than implied with the $53 million full-year number realization in our income statement was certainly influenced by our significant backlog, which drive the timing lag between inflation and offsetting price hitting our PNL. We certainly expect pricing to catch up with costs in 2022. And finally on this page, full-year 2021 free cash flow was about $27 million lower than last year with a $92 million cash interest benefit from debt restructuring, more offset by an inventory build. Cash M&A expenses in higher capex and cash taxes. Now, flipping a couple of slides, we transition from 2021 actuals to 2022 guidance beginning with Slide 12. But before we dive in, you will see that we supply a lot of detail within our 2022 guidance, including first-half, second-half, and quarterly breakouts for expected sales adjusted operating profit, and also pricing and inflation. We are providing this detail because we realize -- absolutely realized we have likely damaged some of our credibility in 2021, notably with the quality of our external guidance. And we want to be fully transparent with you with how we see the year unfolding. It is impossible to understand the dynamics within 2022 with looking at only full-year figures. And as you will see, our anticipated second half of 2022 is much different and much improved from the first half. And each quarter improved sequentially from the previous quarter. This expected improvement both in the second half and with each successive quarter, is driven by accelerating price cost benefit versus 2021. Of course, we understand that providing this level of detail likely creates the expectation for us to supply the same level of details we've progress through the year. And we were absolutely prepared to do that and we will update our assumptions and projections for all inputs as appropriate. And we know that you'll track with us every step of the way. So with that said, finally, getting to the content on Slide 12, this page summarizes our broad expectations for 2022 by splitting our guidance between first and second half. We expect first half to continue to be challenged by parts availability with underlying organic volume when you remove price to be down 5% year-over-year. Despite the record year-end backlog as we do not see significant supply chain constraints lessening at all in the first half of '22 versus what we saw at the end of 2021. In addition, although price costs recovers as we exit the second quarter, it is still projected to be upside down by approximately $70 million for the full first half. The second half is a much different story as we expect financial performance to improve significantly from the first half, we assume 6% higher organic volume. Once again, excluding price and part of that is based on a greater visibility to allocation of parts in the second half. And this second percent higher organic volume and -- could be conservative based upon our backlog and the end market demand. But once again, the underlying driver of improved sales performance in the second half is pricing. Based upon pricing actions that we have already taken; we expect $250 million of incremental year-over-year pricing in the second half alone. And as a result, price cost is expected to be a positive $170 million in the second half. Significantly improve in adjusted operating profit, with adjusted operating margin increasing to 14%. Our expectations for a strong second-half pertains, a strong 2023 as we capture additional year-over-year pricing from actions already taken, as virtually all sales in 2023 will be at the higher pricing. While we have significant sales in 2022, as we mentioned, from our existing backlog at lower historical pricing levels and will further explain this dynamic and a couple of slides. But let's move on to slide 13. This is another slice of our guidance going from a first-half, second-half perspective to a quarterly perspective. Net sales adjusted operating profit, and adjusted operating margins are all projected to sequentially increase as we progress through the year. And as we mentioned on the prior slide, the primary driver of this sequentially improving financial performance is the timing of price realization. The chart at the bottom left illustrates the quarterly profitability trend for both 2021 and 2022. Our price cost issues began in the third quarter of 2021 and we anticipate them to be addressed after the second quarter of this year. So we're almost three quarters of our way through what we see is a fourth quarter issue. As price costs turns positive for each of the last two quarters of 2022. Finally, on this page, the chart at the upper right shows the relatively conservative volume assumptions inherent in the plan. With full-year organic volume, once again, excluding pricing, assume to increase just 1% as we do not assume significantly improving parts availability as we progress through the year. And we will continuously assess that assumption, as we go forward. Next, turning to Slide 14, this page details our year-over-year quarterly price costs or net inflation assumptions for 2022. For the full year, we expect to generate $100 million favorable year-over-year price costs, including the assumption of $360 million of price offset by $260 million of incremental inflation. As discussed in the prior slides, our quarterly pricing increases sequentially as the proportion of sales from existing backlog declines as you can see in the chart at the bottom of the page. Also very important, we should have significant carryover price benefit into 2023 as we expect 95% of next year sales to be at the higher pricing levels. While in 2022, only 50% were, and this drives in an expectation for about $200 million of carryover pricing impact for 2023. Now from an inflation perspective, we assume that what we experienced exiting 2021 will continue through full-year 2022. That's an approximately $160 million year-over-year carryover negative impact. But in addition, we have assumed $100 million of new inflation in 2022. 20 -- as Rob mentioned, 2021 actual inflation outpaced our expectations, each step of the way, and we believe it prudent to assume that inflation will continue to worsen in 2022, which drives the $100 million incremental assumption. And we definitely will reevaluate this new inflation assumption as we progress through 2022. Now based on the foregoing assumptions, we expect price cost to be neutral in the second quarter, and as mentioned, significantly favorable for the second half beginning in the third quarter. Next, turning to Slide 15, this page supplies some color on our confidence that the $360 million pricing number for 2022 is achievable and will stick. The first as we saw in the previous page, the first $125 million of the $360 is actually included in our year-end backlog. So we risk assess that from highly probable to certain. Now the second $235 million is based on pricing projections in new 2022 orders that will book and shift within the year. Based upon the market acceptance of our fourth quarter price increase, evidenced by the 51% increase in orders. We certainly saw the opportunity to be much more aggressive with 2022 pricing. In late 2021 and early 2022, we initiated multiple waves of list price increases. And this is across all product lines in all regions. Although we certainly were a bit more aggressive in both the Americas and EMEA, where inflation has been more pronounced. Based upon our order rates, so far in January and February, which are in line or even a little bit higher than last year's order rates for that same period. It appears that our higher pricing is sticking in this high demand, short supply market environment. Of course, we will continue to reevaluate this assumption and reassess our pricing as we progress through the year. As we have mentioned many times, we believe we operate in a great position in a good industry. Data center demand for our equipment, and more importantly, our technology is not abating anytime soon and it should continue to accelerate going forward. With the backdrop of rising global costs. In this long-term market demand, we believe our price increases are justifiable, reasonable and achievable. But in fact, one lesson learned as we manage price increases over the last nine months or so, is that we have historically underestimated our ability to get price. And based upon the success of our recent price actions, we have absolute confidence that we will be able to drive consistent price increases going forward. Turning to Slide 16, this page summarizes our full-year 2022 financial guidance. We provide added detail in the appendix to aid analysts and investors with modeling. Overall, we expect 13% top-line growth, 8% organic. Components of this organic growth are 7% price and 1% volume, as our assumption is that the supply chain constraints do not significantly ease in 2022 and only in the fourth quarter if at all, we will continue to reassess this possibly conservative assumption as we go through the year, full-year adjusted operating profit is expected to increase $54 million or 11%. With base Vertiv relatively flat, and most of the increase coming from net acquisitions and divestitures, there is an $85 million a year-over-year increase in fixed costs. And we provide some additional color on that increase in the appendix. As we showed in prior slides, quarterly adjusted operating profit and margin increased sequentially with higher pricing. With fourth quarter operating profit projected to be $255 million. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin expected to be $0.15. And fourth quarter. adjust EPS to exceed $0.40 a share. So even though full-year financial metrics are not overly impressive, we should be exiting 2022 in a very good position. Finally, on this page, we summarize both adjusted EPS and free cash flow for 2022, and once again, we supply underlying assumptions for each in the appendix. Now turning to Slide 17, this page summarizes our first quarter financial guidance. As we previewed in prior slides, our performance in the first quarter will continue to be challenged by negative price cost, about $70 million in the quarter and supply chain constraints will unfavorably affect year-over-year organic volume. We estimate by about $45 million. Now, the net impact is not great as shown by the expected $20 million adjusted operating loss. But these first quarter results should be the net year for our quarterly financial performance, as we project consistent quarterly improvement as we go through 2022 based on actions we have already initiated, including by delivering $360 million of higher pricing for full-year 2022, but also pricing actions should deliver an additional carryover impact of $200 million into 2023. Now with that said, I turn it back over to Rob."

We got caught up in supply chain challenges that reflects most of the world and we did not appropriately anticipate inflationary pressures, we would experience as we tried to obtain parts, we needed to manufacture our products. We have a great position in a good industry. We have world-class products and service offerings. We have a talented team. We are relevant to our customers.

We have a very tight, rigorous process that goes all the way up to certain levels and including myself, depending on what discounts are trying to do. So we hold that tight from that perspective, so that they don't have the freedom to just discount, to build backlog or to go book orders. And in different parts of the world, we have profitability as part of the overall sales compensation. So again, the answer would be no, they're not paid to book unprofitable business."

To be clear, we didn't see the rate of inflation that we're actually experiencing till later in the quarter and the later month. We did however see an increase in spot buys and expedited freight in order to counter supplier decommit. So when we came out in our last earnings call, supply for us with certain suppliers, with our products actually got worse and de -commits happened and accelerated throughout the quarter. So it really wasn't necessarily, I would say a cultural issue as more of a system issue and our ability to see that as we changed over ERP. And secondly, we consciously made decisions to pay expedited freight and drive spot buys in order to counter the de -commits from our suppliers."

And Rob and I got significantly more involved with what did we have to do to resolve the cultural issues that did exist in the America s, and that's been addressed. When it came to inflation, it was clear we had been under forecasting what was going to happen with inflation. And I would argue some of that was a cultural issue, also, which we have addressed."

But we've had to get much more heavily involved in resolving these issues. confident, they have been resolved and they will continue to work with the new process. And it's why I'm encouraged by what I see for the second half, which I think gives us a very good lead into the future and gets us back where we should have been all along. I think Dave's right. The -- one of our learnings from all this is how we've underestimated our ability to get price. Historically, not just currently, but historically. And that's another dynamic that's going to change.

As it relates to cultural issues. Again, the organization probably -- not probably, organization didn't and wasn't set up to drive a lot of price previous years, we've shown $20, $25 million in price. And what we really had to do really top down. Dave, myself, and others in the management team is really drive all the way down to the sales people. What it means to get price, how to get price, and not to be afraid to lose orders as we go through that. So that's something culturally losing orders with something that we had to overcome and say, it's okay from the perspective of, we've got to go drive price. And it's proven out that that works and that we were able to get price as Dave mentioned, probably should have and could have got more price in Q4 and Americas with the order backlog that we saw, the other cultural issue that they talked about is really the FIOP process for Americas, and really having that tighter pulled together so that the demand and the supply and those constraints, we're working closely together, coupled by an exacerbation of that, of a new ERP system that came in that we had lack of visibility for a period of time which has now since then fixed from that perspective. So it's on the culture side and then on the process side, we are well beyond the implementation of our ERP as it relates to and by evidence of January's results, we have visibility into what our PPV is and our price purchase variances and have a good handle on what inflation's looking like. So we were behind throughout the quarter, as Dave mentioned, got into December, recognize what was going on and have implemented both process changes as I talked earlier on pricing levels of approval, as well as a process levels with the integration of Americas, operations and supply and sales, and any other comments, David Fallon or David Cote?"

It sounds like it requires much more direct marching orders, perhaps that has happened and it was a conveyed in that answer.

Combination of myself, Dave Cote being involved and Dave Fallon have given strict marching orders or what needs to happen. They need to make it happen. So it's not, they go figure it out and come report out to us. We have given specific instructions as to what they need to do, what needs to happen, guess what Dave is saying is they need to drive that, make that happen, we will monitor that, but no doubt that from top down, we're driving that message to the team, the three of us. Secondly, on the ERP system, as you know, all the ERP systems are difficult in their own ways and in this particular one, while things went cut-over, we were able to continue to ship and do the basic business functions that you'd expect to do that some people get caught up. We didn't have that problem. It was more of an understanding of the price variance and things that we didn't get to later on. We've since then fixed that as any ERP system, you do have things you fixed after the launch. And that's where we got caught up and kind of got behind on the visibility and then begin to better understand that as we got into December and really towards the end of January, and it took us a little bit longer to assess where we were at and making sure that we now understand our PPV.

As to having the team figure it out, and the approach that we took, this is a tool that I generally use, and I've talked about in the past, because you can't have the CEO always having to tell people just work together. They have to do it, they have to recognize the problem, and they have to fix the processes themselves, and have to come up with, here's how we're going to do it going forward. And it starts with, they got to recognize they have a problem, which they have done. And the fixes that they've developed didn't just fix what we had as the current forecast, but it's going to get fixed going forward. And like with any new process, you don't just set it up and walk away. You still have to monitor, or use a stronger word, be involved to understand that it's happening.

There are some elements of that guide that might be one-off. So for example, our capex for 2022 is projected to be about $130 million. That's probably a little bit elevated, number one, some of the 21 capex split into 22, but we do have some capacity expansion dollars in there as well. I would say a more normalized capex number, on an annual basis is probably around a $100 million or so. So that's one element. The number one driver of the free cash flow, in the long-term is going to be the EBITDA. And the full year EBITDA is certainly not what it should be for 2022, but if you look at what we're going to do in the second half, notably in Q4, you annualize that, that is going to be a direct contributor to much higher free cash flow. And I think our guidance at the beginning of '21 was $285 million. I would say, based on where we are, especially after the pricing increases go through, our run rate should be much higher than that. It's a little bit of a hypothetical but our overall goal is to get a 100% of free cash flow and the conversion on that income. The other thing I would add, Jeff for Mr. Sprague is that if U -- AOP is a good indicator, I think of operating cash flow. And if you take a look at our fourth-quarter run rate, and then the $200 million of price carryover in 23 that Dave referenced earlier, that puts us in a very good AOP position. That is the biggest driver of what free cash flow will be."

And most notably in EMEA, as we exited the year. So there is a provision per conservatism, but certainly a part of that $100 million is based on what we're seeing currently, so it would be hard for me to handicap a specific dollar for what we're seeing and how much it is conservatism, but that's something that we will better be able to reassess as we go through the year and we can provide an update on that at the end of the first quarter."

And steel prices have come down fairly nicely since the mid fourth quarter. We've seen some of that benefit in our Q1 pricing. But if the lower steel prices hold through the end of Q1, we should definitely see a benefit in Q2. We have not built into any of our forecast.

So that's something we have done and put into the contracts. It wasn't in all of our contracts prior, so we're looking at we can never predict where it's going to go and we believe what David just said, but I would say as a backstop, the ability to get additional price, if necessary, if things continue beyond a threshold from that perspective. As it relates to supply, I mentioned earlier in my discussion was, we've done a few things, we're not just sitting here saying how we can't get it. We've either qualified additional suppliers, we've modified, or re-engineered certain parts and allowed for additional supply base to help us out. So as it relates to, we keep continue to talk about fans being a problem with qualified additional vendors there and also have changed some of the design there that uncouples it from maybe some of the constraints that we have. So we look at that, whether it's displays, whether it's qualifying additional IGBTs vendors, which is a big part of our power conversion products and the DC power, one of the things you'll see from us is that from a IGBT perspective, which is the power conversion, we have a DC power business that most of our competitors don't. We buy a significant amount of those. So getting additional supply base, additional suppliers. And a lot of this got started even pre all of this inflationary and supply constraint. It was really as COVID hit, and it taught us a lesson to qualify and drive additional suppliers. And we'll continue to do that, even as, hopefully at some point in time, who knows when inflation goes in the -- we have deflation in the other direction. Our strategy is still to make sure that we have multiple suppliers all the way down through our design process so that we don't single source. And those fires aren't just in one particular region, they have multiple regions because we've learned that, while I may have multiple suppliers and they might be fan vendors out of Germany, that could cause a problem. I need to have supply base in different parts of the region."

This year, we will definitely use cash so similar to the financial projections, the free cash flow should progressively improve as we go through the year as well. I would say sometime probably early third quarter would be the bottom point as it relates to liquidity. We do have as we mentioned, we resolve the tax receivable agreement. There's a $50 million payment at the end of June and the September. I think soon after that $50 million payment at the end of the June would be the bottom part.

As I mentioned earlier, some of the behavioral changes that we've put in place across the world is really authority and approval. One of the quickest ways to get there is stop discounting. We've raised these prices appropriately, but you can lose price through discounting. We've changed those thresholds across the globe. We've changed the level in which those decisions can be made all the way up to myself and David as CFO so that we don't give away the pricing that we were getting through discounting. So that is a I'd call it a cultural thing and a change that we implemented over the over the last 60, 90 days. And we believe that very effective, although painful for the organization, it's the right thing to do to guarantee that we get this price. Could you take a look at specifically Americas, what the dynamic that's going on there and our market overall is -- it's a [Indiscernible], constraint in general, lead times have gone out for whether it's generators, whether it's breakers, whatever it might be. And I think what we saw is -- and what we'll continue to see is people are putting orders and to get their slots to make sure they get supply where that used to be maybe they order 6 months ahead, 3 months ahead. In some cases, they're ordering and looking at 12, maybe 18 months as we go forward. The demand is extremely strong on a global basis, and that's why you're seeing that uptick overall. It wasn't a rush to get it before price because of a lot of that had pricing actions that were taken in November, back in October or September, and then more recently in December. The strength for us really comes from -- a lot around the Colo Cloud, but also even in the channel. We've seen growth as we continue to increase price there. We continue to see growth around the Vertiv product offering. David on the third one? Or Gary."

Thank you, your last question was specifically around pricing in the backlog, and so the pricing of the backlog, as we entered January first was right around $125 million give or take a little bit. So probably just north of 4%, 4.5% somewhere in that range. And if you look at the momentum with the pricing that we had in 2021, every quarter got stronger with Q4 being the high point. So we feel good to whatever one\u2019s comments have been up to this point in time that it really is. We had to believe it ourselves almost in order to be able to take that next step function. So we saw that step function in Q4 between that data point, between the data point of $125 - ish million of pricing in the backlog going into this year as Number 2 and then Number 3, even what we've seen in January so far in early February, the price increases that we put out at the end of Q4 and even in Q doesn't seem to have materially changed the order input right at this point in time.

I don't know what your competitors are doing because they are buried in larger organizations. But I mean, do you see the same kind of behavior from them as well, or is this something unique and specific to you guys?

Traditionally, I think culturally you may have heard earlier, we didn't think -- David said, we didn't think as a company we could go out and be strong with a price. But what I really see is happening, where we're getting prices, where we're differentiating, where we're developing, call them unique or innovative products and solutions. And the organization -- you're absolutely right. The industry culturally hasn't gone there because a lot of areas haven't been providing innovation. So where we have innovated in certain areas, like thermal management and so forth, those are areas that we found on learns to this. So we can actually get price and continue to get price for innovation. And that's the basis of our thesis. And reason we've been driving our R&D up is, fundamentally, we believe with innovation providing stronger products with customers we can get that price, we can get a higher price than those that aren't innovating in those section and as you may know, we don't compete, I know lot of people think it's just the big guys that are part of big conglomerates. We compete with a lot of locals that you wouldn't know that don't report out. And those also are experiencing these commodity are specific price cost issues as well. So we have seen people follow and we look at the different parts of the market. And as we've gone to it, what we found is we're Vertiv products are preferred where we have that innovation pricing sticks and people will pay us more. So we've learned something through this process and we will continue to apply that throughout the years. And the other --"

And this process has shown us that not only is our new innovation worth more than we thought, the innovation that already exist in our products and it's been historically under-priced, and this has been a really good warning for all of us in the business.

There's a lot more companies involved in the Tier 2, Tier 3 colos, a lot more building going -- being done for the hyperscalers. What I'd say is, it wasn't just an unusual time or one-off.

As mentioned earlier, the incentive from the sales side. And again, depending on the part of the world, is primarily right now driven by their ability to discount or not discount. Sales -- they need to get sales with price to get more quota at the higher price. I guess in general, the higher price they get, the more quota attainment they retire. And it's true for, if I take a look at the selling regime that we have in America today, the salespeople are incented to get a higher price because they've got a higher multiplier and a higher commission when it comes to that. I'd say that we feel like the areas we need to really shore up was where that price leakage could happen on big deals and other areas and really push back on that and put higher levels of approval so that we're not giving price away further down in the organization. So I feel confident that both sales and management throughout the globe understands and gets the price and understand what it's going to mean to them, ultimately, in their wallet."

And as we discussed with Lance, it's not fair to just annualize that from a operating margin perspective into 2023, but it's a great start. And we would say we would be right back on track where our plans were, let's say, six months ago with our -- with the timing of getting the near-term adjusted operating margin up to 16%. So I would say as we exit 2022, I would say things are back to normal and even to a certain extent, maybe a little bit more accelerated than where we thought especially with E&I adjusted operating margin also returning to the levels that we expect it.\n\ufeffQ - Andrew Obin: Thank you for the call out. Just clarification, slide 13, just understanding 110% of pricing in the first half versus a 120%, 130% in Q3, Q4. It's just -- I'm just -- I don't quite understand how a year-over-year comps for it because well, right. Because it's sort of a weak comp of an easy comp and then we have a strong comp of strong comps in the second half, maybe I missed something on the call, I apologize for that but just to understand why it's only a 110% in the first half, given that the comps are low or given that we got 130% and 120% in Q3 and Q4, respectively.

And the pricing that we get for book and ship deliveries is certainly higher than what's in the backlog. The dynamic there, it's $110 million in the first half and much higher in the second half, is directly driven by the amount of sales that come out of backlog in the first half and the amount of sales that come from book and ship in the second half.\n\ufeffQ - Andrew Obin: And so that implies that there was a lot of more book-and-ship in Q3 and Q4.

                "text": "Good morning, everyone. The current environment we're operating in is certainly a challenging one. I can't remember a tying analogous to it. You can see from the press that demand remains strong in almost every end market and ours is very strong especially with our new product initiatives. In the short-term, we have to continue to fight the battles for component parts to support our customers and we need to get ahead of the price inflation curve that Rob will tell you more about. While this is a painful and an irritating time to deal with it is what it is. And I can assure you we will come out of this admirably especially given our investments in the long term. We're, obviously, enthused about the E&I acquisition, which we will do very well with. Gary and I were down in the E&I facility at South Carolina a few weeks ago with Phil, brainstorming and reviewing the cost and revenue synergies we know we can create over the next several years. In addition to the synergy review, we discussed the investments we can make in further products and services, process improvements, people and systems that will pay dividends over the medium and long-term. There is a lot happening in the business that portends a superb future. So while we continue planning and executing for the future, we recognize we also got to get through the current situation and do everything we can to continue supporting our customers, which we will do. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob. Rob?"

                "text": "Thank you Dave. The reviews that you continue to conduct with me and the team always leave us in a better place and our business is actually in a much better place because of your involvement. So all of you on today's call thank you for being here. I'm eager for you to hear more about our 2021 third quarter performance, our outlook on the market and an update on our portfolio. There are six key messages I want to convey today. First, as Dave mentioned demand for Vertiv products and services remain strong. During our last earnings call, we reported second quarter sales were up more than 25% and orders were up 24% compared to the second quarter of last year. I'm pleased to report that sales and orders are up again in Q3. Sales were up 6%, which is very much in line with the guidance we provided in our last update and orders were up 17%. In addition, our Q3 backlog rose to $2.4 billion, the highest it's ever been. Second, profitability is up. This quarter our adjusted operating profit was $131 million, up $64 million from last year's third quarter. This resulted in adjusted operating margin expansion of 490 basis points. Third, year-to-date free cash flow is greater today than it was this time last year. Free cash flow for Q3 was $44 million and year-to-date is $128 million. For a year -- from a year-to-date perspective this represents an improvement of over $140 million versus the first three quarters of 2020. Fourth, as Dave mentioned, we are dealing like others with supply chain and inflationary issues. We encountered supply chain challenges in Q3 and experienced commodity and freight inflation. We made spot buys, so that we can meet our delivery commitments we've made to our customers, and we have implemented strategies to recapture those costs. Pricing always lagged cost by a few quarters and that's exactly what we're seeing now. However, we believe as we've mentioned before, pricing will be a tailwind in 2022. Fifth. We expect to close the E+I acquisition by November 1, which is a month earlier than previously communicated. In addition, we've signed an agreement to sell our heavy industrial UPS business and we expect to close that transaction by the end of Q4. And the final key message is, we are confirming our latest guidance for the Vertiv base and slightly increasing our guidance for the impact of the M&A transaction. Turning to slide four. This is the chart we use to illustrate what we're seeing in each of our world regions, in each of our end markets. In the cloud and hyperscale colocation markets, they continue to remain strong, as evidenced by the green buttons. The demand for digital continues to fuel the industry and is driving a strong and growing need for Vertiv products and services. In our enterprise and small to medium business market, we continue to see signs of progress. Enough progress is made in Americas to upgrade this segment from yellow to green. We continue to experience an increase in the pipeline and orders with Americas leading the way. The communication networks had a few moments. We saw 5G deployments in earlier parts of the year, being very robust and began to see that slow or a digestion over the last quarter or so. We've experienced Europe beginning to deploy 5G and we see consistent deployment in Americas. In the commercial and industrial markets, things remain consistent. While this is a smaller size of our business, the variety of products and services we sell here continue to expand. Moving to slide five. As referenced in my opening slide, our order rates continue to be robust. Our Q3 order rates were up 17% over Q3 of 2020 and on a year-to-date basis are up 21% versus the same time period last time, with cloud and colocation segment leading our way. Vertiv's executive team remains closely connected to the accounts and we're seeing the strong demand continue. Because of the deliberate connections we are making, we are gaining further visibility into customer demand, leading to advanced orders and insight to their future pipelines that we haven't seen in the past, which is a tremendous help in our demand planning as we go forward. This and other actions, we are taking have led to a record backlog as I mentioned earlier of $2.4 billion, which is 34% higher than our backlog was at the end of 2020. As you heard from Dave in his opening comments, supply chain continues to pose challenges for us and many, many others in the industry. Each of the regions are experiencing it, but it is most acute in Americas, where material availability is most difficult and commodity prices have risen beyond expectations. Where necessary, we'll continue to use spot buys, so that we can take care of our customers. From a pricing standpoint, we are in line with our prior guidance we provided for Q4. We'll continue with pricing actions throughout 2022. Moving to slide six. When we spoke last, we expected to close the E+I deal by December 1, but I'm very pleased that we will be able to close this deal a month earlier, due to the diligence of the combined Vertiv and E+I teams and with help from our transaction partners. We had successfully -- we had a successful debt raise a few weeks back and all antitrust hurdles have been cleared. The market reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. Gary, Phil, our Regional President, I have been on the phone with hundreds of customers and the receptivity to the deal is exactly what we wanted, very optimistic and very excited. Integration planning has started right after the deal was signed and I look forward to entering into the execution mode in a few days. While E+I orders remain very strong, they are facing site readiness and supply issues on electric components no different than others in the industry. Now, let's turn to divestitures of the heavy-duty industrial UPS business. We have signed an agreement to sell this business to a financial sponsor called InnovaFonds. InnovaFonds will retain the existing management team, which makes for a very easy transition and provides for great customer continuity. We expect this transaction as mentioned early to close by the end of Q4. With that I'll turn it over to David to take a closer look at the Q3 numbers and we'll come back with some final comments at the end. David? "

                "text": "Great. Thanks Rob. Turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our third quarter financial results. Net sales were up $67 million or 6% and 4% when adjusted for a $20 million foreign exchange tailwind. However, our third quarter top line was negatively impacted by continued challenges with procuring electronic parts as underlying market demand is much stronger than implied in our year-over-year quarterly sales growth. The strong underlying market demand was evident with third quarter orders as Rob mentioned which were up 17% after increasing over 20% in the first half of the year. Adjusted operating profit of $131 million was just above the midpoint of our guidance range and increased $64 million or 94% from last year's third quarter which included an $80 million charge for restructuring and an asset write-off. Contribution margin in the third quarter continued to be negatively impacted by material and freight inflation which outpaced our pricing by approximately $40 million in the quarter. We expect to further narrow the imbalance between inflation and price in the fourth quarter and expect net price inflation to be favorable for full year 2022 as a result of incremental pricing actions in the fourth quarter and into next year. Adjusted operating margin of 10.7% was 490 basis points higher than last year's third quarter, but approximately 200 basis points lower when last year is adjusted for the restructuring and asset write-off charge. And this year-over-year reduction is driven entirely by net inflation. Finally on this page free cash flow of $44 million was approximately $85 million lower than last year and we will address the components of that delta in just a couple of slides. But despite this quarterly unfavorable variance year-to-date free cash flow of $128 million is still approximately $140 million higher than the same period last year. Next turning to Page 8. This slide summarizes our third quarter segment results. The Americas region continues to be more impacted by supply chain challenges than the two other regions due to regional differences in the paid for material inflation and availability of electronic parts. These supply chain challenges negatively impacted both America's top and bottom line with net sales up just $5 million or 1% against the strong market backdrop and adjusted operating margin was down approximately 400 basis points driven primarily by net inflation. Moving to the right, APAC net sales were up approximately 4% but relatively flat on an organic basis as last year's third quarter benefited from China government investment in several telecom and wind power programs. Third quarter adjusted operating margin in APAC was up both before and after adjusting for the $11 million restructuring charge in last year's third quarter. EMEA continues to post very strong financial performance with net sales up 19% from last year's third quarter and adjusted operating margin was up almost 300 basis points after adjusting for last year's $41 million regional restructuring charge. And although not immune to the effects of net inflation the EMEA supply chain environment at least to date has been less disrupted than the other two regions. Next turning to Slide 9. This chart bridges the third quarter free cash flow from last year down about $85 million to $44 million. The most significant negative variance is driven by a $43 million inventory build in this year's third quarter in part due to several large project delays and the strategic stocking of certain electronic parts to protect future customer deliveries. CapEx was approximately $10 million higher this year versus last year. And certainly last year's third quarter was negatively impacted by certain COVID constraints. On a year-to-date basis free cash flow is up $128 million. And we reaffirm our full year free cash flow guidance of $205 million, which includes approximately $45 million cash outflow for M&A transaction expenses. Next turning to slide 10. This page summarizes our fourth quarter financial guidance, which includes provision for base Vertiv prior to M&A activity plus the expected impact of the E&I acquisition and the industrial UPS business divestiture. So, we're avoiding the doubt, we M&A transaction closing and other expenses in our financial results and guidance, $18 million in the third quarter, which includes a $9 million impairment loss for the sale of the industrial UPS business and $51 million in the fourth quarter or $69 million total transaction expenses for the full year. And we summarize our non-GAAP treatment of these expenses in the reconciliations in the appendix to this presentation. Our base Vertiv net sales guidance is up approximately $35 million from our previous guidance, based upon improved visibility of our supply and shipment schedules in the fourth quarter. We have also added $55 million incremental net sales from M&A, including $65 million from E&I offset by $10 million reduced sales from the industrial UPS business divestiture. As Rob mentioned, when we announced the E&I transaction at the beginning of September, we anticipated a December one closing date and $45 million of incremental fourth quarter revenue from E&I. Now with the acceleration of the anticipated closing date to November 1, we expect $65 million of incremental E&I revenue in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating profit for base Vertiv is materially in line with our previous guidance at $540 million, with the benefit from higher net sales offset by higher expected gross material and freight inflation versus our early September guidance. We have added approximately $13 million in operating profit to our guidance for M&A and that includes $15 million for E&I assuming a November one closing date once again. And that $15 million is offset by approximately $2 million from the sale of the industrial UPS business expected to close in early December. Compared with last year's fourth quarter net sales are expected to be up 8%, adjusted operating profit up 16% with 90 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin. Adjusted EPS is expected to be down approximately $0.02 per share, but the year-over-year comparison certainly is negatively impacted by the timing of income tax expense in this year's fourth quarter, which is artificially high due to the quarterly treatment of some nondeductible losses from the changes in the fair value of the warrant liability. Next turning to slide 11. We summarized our full year 2021 financial guidance, which includes base Vertiv and provision for the M&A activity. Full year net sales are expected to be $5 billion for the full year, and that's up 14% from 2020 including M&A. And the adjusted operating profit for 2021 is expected to be $553 million, up 62% from 2020, and still up 22% when adjusted for the $113 million of 2020 pro forma items. Our full year adjusted operating profit guidance for base Vertiv is unchanged from our previous guidance so that's at $540 million. And adjusted operating margin for the full year is expected to be 11.1%, up 330 basis points from 2020 and still up 70 basis points when adjusted for 2020 pro forma items. Our full year free cash flow guidance of $205 million remains unchanged from previous guidance. And once again this includes approximately $45 million of expected M&A cash transaction and closing expenses. So, with that said I turn it back over to Rob."

                "text": "Well, thanks David. Let's turn to slide 12. Well, almost all the commentary thus far has been focused on 2021. We did want to provide an early glimpse of 2022 which we're really excited about. From a topline perspective, we clearly enter the year with a backlog that's significantly higher than what we came into in 2021. And from my view right now the backlog will be approximately $500 million higher than previous. As discussed on the earlier slide, our markets continue to show strong demand for our products. All signs are pruning to cloud and colocation markets remaining robust globally and from an enterprise perspective, demand should continue at the same pace we're seeing it today. During our last few calls, we highlighted some of the Vertiv product development initiatives we have underway and these products only accelerate in 2022 and beyond. We continue to invest in new product development and go-to-market strategies. From a potential headwind standpoint, we're expecting to see parts shortages last at least through the first half of next year. We also know customers are dealing with trade labor shortages and difficulty in getting some of the key building materials that they need. While it's difficult to predict the exact impact on us, these are very real issues and our customers are dealing with them on a day-to-day basis. As for profitability in 2022, we expect pricing will be a tailwind. We will have a full year of E+I in our results which will be accretive. We will continue to deploy the tenants of VOS, fixed cost constant, and as mentioned earlier still funding incremental R&D and growth initiatives. We do expect inflation to continue into 2022. But even at today's level we are planning next year to be net positive on price. Turning to slide 13, as I close I want you to know how proud I am with the Vertiv team and what we together as one Vertiv have accomplished in the first nine months. The results we've shared today are reflective of the hard work and commitment of our 20000 employees globally some of the factories, some in the field, some in the offices, and some still working remotely in over 130 countries. As I look at the remaining month of 2021 as we continue to invest strategically, I'm confident we will see above-market top line growth increase in profitability and strengthening in our balance sheet. When I look down the road at 2022 and beyond my confidence is bolstered by the conversations I've had personally with partners and customers around the globe about demand, pricing, and future pipelines. To all employees, I'm grateful for you and the part you played in the past three months that have allowed me to provide today's earnings report. Thank you for your dedication and your tireless efforts to take care of the customer. To our investors thank you all for being on the call today. Thank you for your trust and support. It's truly my pleasure to be leading Vertiv. I'll now turn the call over to the operator to open up the line for questions."

And when you talk about price cost positive in 2022, are you talking on -- I'm sure you at least me on a dollar basis, but I wonder if you also see it being positive on a margin rate basis?"

First of all I'd like to start off by saying that we and it's on me have under-forecasted what inflation was going to do. And therefore, we haven't received the pricing level necessary to offset inflation in previous quarters. I can assure you going forward with our robust pricing actions and what we are doing now and we'll be doing in 2022 that we will be positive in price based on what we're executing on. So again, I just wanted to let everyone know on the call today that under forecasted inflation, we understand where that's at. We're even assuming that it could get potentially worse, and we're making sure that our pricing actions now and going forward cover that. David?"

                "speaker": "David Fallon",
                "text": "Yes. Yes. Thanks Rob. Good morning Jeff. So I think if you look at the numbers and where we stand or where we expect to stand at the end of the fourth quarter is that in a do-nothing scenario, which is not going to happen in a do-nothing scenario the wraparound effect of net price inflation is probably a small tailwind in the $5 million to $10 million range. So we're certainly encouraged with what we're seeing in the pricing environment here in the fourth quarter. As you mentioned, it's about a $15 million step up from Q3, but we're certainly not satisfied. As Rob mentioned, we've left some dollars on the table this year, because we've underestimated inflation. And we certainly are going to be much more aggressive and we have current plans in action to continue those price increases fairly significantly into 2022. But from a wraparound impact looking at the numbers, a floor is probably a $5 million to $10 million tailwind. And of course, we are in our pricing plans anticipating that inflation will continue to accelerate whether it does or not, I don't think anybody knows, but we're anticipating that it will accelerate. And of course, we anticipate a much more significant dollar tailwind. And I appreciate your comment on the -- as it relates to recapturing the margin percentage. I would say that is our intent and we do appreciate the math of trying to do that. You could recapture the dollars but not recapture the percentages, but just to let you know we are looking at that dynamic as well and that certainly is our long-term goal."

Good to see the green dot little color on the magnitude of the activity there and maybe anything you could share on the type of customer or what type of work is starting to manifest itself there?"

                "text": "Sure Jeff. This is Rob. I'll start off and then Gary might add some additional color. What we're seeing right now and especially in Americas as we mentioned is kind of a rebound of small to medium business and enterprise, as they go back to work, refreshing their networks, their network closets. So we've seen that activity in the channel space for us beginning to pick up. And that's why we moved it from yellow to green. We're also seeing in the enterprise areas people reconfiguring their data centers, taking the time projects they probably put on hold during the pandemic and now they're getting back to some new builds, some reconfiguration on build, as they build out their hybrid cloud strategies going forward and right-size, I guess, I would say the current data centers that will be on-prem. So that's what really gives us confidence led by Americas haven't seen parts of Asia, we didn't talk much about, because Asia as you know is still being played on and off with COVID. We expect hopefully going into Q1 next year Q2 that those activities that COVID would clear itself up and we could see enterprise going in the right direction there. And in Europe, we're continuing to execute on our channel strategy there to drive more and more enterprise business. But in general, corporations are spending money. They are taking care of their infrastructure now that people are getting back into the office."

How does that \u2013 logistically, what does that mean for you guys? Does it mean that orders get delayed it's that simple, or does the customer because of lack of supply kind of take \u2013 want to take delivery anyways and just warehouse things so that they don't have further delays once they get kind of brick-and-mortar down? How does that kind of logistically work? Are we just \u2013 or do we not know yet, Rob?"

While we don't know exactly, which sites are going to be impacted, what we are seeing is customers willing to take that inventory in some cases and warehouses, so they have it when that site does turn on, so they don't lose their production slot, or they don't lose their equipment to somebody else. That being said, that's more of a new phenomenon. And as I reach out to more of our large customers more and more of them are wanting some type of program to have inventory go ahead and take it off our hands and take the responsibility of it. But it's a really dynamic situation. And even things as roofing systems, which you think would be simple have gone out to 44 weeks in lead times. So they are being stressed not by necessarily the equipment manufacturers. If I look at the lead times, yes, they've gone out, but not near as far as some of these other base building materials that they need for their sites. That being said, our business is a combination of new builds and brownfields, and we feel good about that. But some of the larger projects will experience site difficulties from time to time due to trade labor and so on."

And then in the same context, when you've missed a sale over the last quarter, because of supply chain, has there been instances where that sale has kind of gone away or somebody else has been able to supply it, or is the entire market just so tight that the stuff just gets moved into backlog and everybody is comfortable with the fact that deliveries will just be a little late?"

We've been very honorable with what we've told our customers, and we've not played that game. So I'd say, while that's happening, it's very little. I mean, the market is tight for everybody. And we've seen without going into detail smaller competitors and even larger competitors \u2013 we commit. As you know, we were one of the first companies to come out and talk about this issue, and we did it around the announcement of the acquisition, because we felt that was fair, and honest to let you guys know exactly what we're seeing. But I don't think we're penalized any worse than anybody else and the backlog will continue to grow. And quite honestly, people will continue to drive further visibility. And I mentioned that earlier in my discussions, I like the visibility we're getting. The industry has traditionally not shared that, because they feel it's a competitive issue, because we work with a lot of competitors \u2013 to our customers, and they want to make sure. But what we're finding is building those relationships and that collaborative relationship we're able to get even a longer view into the builds and locations, which is going to help us in the future of our planning and expansion of capacity."

Just \u2013 we feel confident that that should be \u2013 this should be the peak number. And as you go through 2022 that number should start to become positive. Is that the right way to think about it? And kind of where do you see it's actually positive in 2022?"

And Q3's $40 million I think it was $25 million in Q2. We anticipate inflation to stay at the same level in Q4, but pricing to ramp up about $15 million. So that imbalance should drop to $25 million for Q4. And if you look at just pure wraparound effect, it would be a $10 million imbalance in Q1 of 2022. But of course that does not contemplate any additional pricing actions and we would anticipate to get to a point where those two elements offset one another sometimes in the first quarter."

And when I think about this market environment chart -- slide that you folks have, it seems to us at least that some of the key verticals are starting to inflect higher. I think Facebook on the hyperscale side talked about CapEx being up 65% next year in 2022. And then enterprise IT spend I think is equally starting to pick up at the bigger enterprise companies. I guess, all the data would suggest that growth, if you're levered to data center, should accelerate and be better in 2022 versus 2021. I wonder if you'd agree with that broadly and if not, what are the offsets that we should consider with that statement?"

As it relates to -- and we get asked this all the time and that -- what's happening, is this -- there's always been a build and fill situation where we have this absorption going on and what's different, why is it different now? You're absolutely right, colo and hyperscalers, more money is being poured into that. The utilization rates are high. What's going to be the limiting factor for the growth, not necessarily orders growth, but growth on the sales side and delivery is going to be that material and labor shortages on probably their end. But at the end of the day, the appetite, as far as I can see out and we typically have 18 to 24 months look ahead on the pipeline and things like that, looks very robust. And that's why, I'm very bullish right now that, get these supply issues behind us, which are a big nuisance for all of us. And get moving forward, the market needs more critical data centers."

So the backlog of $40 million of growth exiting the year, I mean, just the simple math gets you double-digit growth of your 2021 revenue base, which I know is not the right way to think about it, but I'll ask the question anyway. Does that imply double-digit growth in 2022, just from the backlog? And then, within that, are we seeing any change in China? Because the tech companies are getting defenestrated in China. So just curious, if that's having any impact on their CapEx plans or capacity plans in any way?"

China is -- moving to China, a lot of stuff in the news about what's going on with China, how they're cracking down on some of the hyperscale activities. Certainly, the power outages because of the coal issues, which has not been affecting us currently right now, because we're deemed essential and we continue to run as we provide. It is a dynamic environment over there. And as you know, when China decides to do something and put a stimulus in, like they did in the beginning of the year for 5G growth and some other things, we do see kind of a higher-than-average growth. But in general, we feel good about our position, our focus on product development being local there. And continue to grow our share there."

I would say there's, two things that are driving the enhancements and margins we think this year. One is definitely centered on the fixed cost constant philosophy. So we continue to not only keep fixed cost constant in EMEA, but we've actually been able to take costs down, as it relates to the investment in some of the restructuring. So we certainly see a benefit there from the leverage. So with sales up, as significant as they are there, and our anticipation for the full year is that they should be in that upper-teens sales growth. We certainly are benefiting from that fixed cost leverage. That's probably the primary driver. I mentioned on the call that the supply chain environment in EMEA probably has been a little less disruptive than the other two regions, but they still are negative from a contribution margin perspective, as it relates to net price cost. I would say most of the lift we've seen this year is because of the fixed cost dynamic."

But I'm just trying to understand the accelerating order growth that you saw which was quite noticeable to 17% year-on-year. How much of that is would we say organic, or is that just reflecting the price increases that you're putting in place? I'm just trying to get a sense for is volume picking up as well at least from a demand perspective? I know obviously there are issues with respect to your ability to fulfill. And then, the next question is, should we expect the above-average inventory build that we saw in the third quarter? How long does that persist? Is that sort of through the first half of 2022 as well? And is the kind of $40 million to $45 million of incremental build per quarter. Is that a good run rate to model, or is that -- or is there something else we should be thinking about there? Thanks."

As it relates to the growth and I think we talked last time, when we announced the E+I acquisition we're posting up around 12% orders growth. We did see an acceleration, I would say, it's hard to kind of break out I'd say right now the price and that certainly there's some price in there, but we're seeing a strong strength in demand. Part of that is people are placing POs as we are as a company a little further ahead in the future so that they make sure they get in line. But in general the market is pretty robust. As you see -- begin to see the comment that someone made earlier around the CapEx that the hyperscalers and colo companies are spending. So certainly there's some price in there for sure but there's also just a strong underlying growth in the market, David, second half?"

So if you look at year-to-date inventory, it's probably up $130 million from the end of last year and with approximately $40 million build in the quarter. It's not unusual for us to build inventory during the year and then have that come down in the fourth quarter based on what is usually a very strong sales quarter. I think we're going to see a little bit of that dynamic this year, but probably a little muted. I would anticipate year-end inventory declining somewhat but very much dependent upon the dynamic out there as it relates to the parts shortage. We certainly are not artificially constraining ourselves to hit any internal inventory days or turnover targets. If we can find the parts, we're making the right business decision and we'll buy the parts and we'll park in an inventory to protect delivery for 2022. With that said, we're very mindful of the impact that inventory has on free cash flow, a very important metric for us and we are implementing actions to optimize that inventory level. So I would anticipate a dip in Q1, but we could see an additional build \u2013 I'm sorry, a dip in Q4 and we could see an additional build as we go through the first half of next year."

When you were answering Jeff's question about the floor on pricing the $5 million to $10 million \u2013 or price cost, the $5 million to $10 million for 2022. Does that include the pricing actions that you've taken to date? I assume it does but I just wanted to check on that. And then I guess like with the view that 3Q is the worst and that's behind you is that based on your view that inflation kind of gets worse in the fourth quarter, or is that assuming normal spot rates inflation is kind of peaking. Just wanted to understand the philosophy behind that?"

                "text": "Yes. Thanks, Nicole. This is David. So I'll grasp your second question first. So our assumption is that inflation in Q4 is consistent with inflation in Q3. And if you want to put a specific number to it, I think everybody at some point will be able to triangulate all these numbers on a quarterly basis. But we're assuming $55 million of year-over-year gross inflation in Q4. That was the same number that we saw in Q3. So we don't anticipate that inflation gets any better or worse in Q4 versus Q3 and that's consistent with what we've seen so far in the month of October. As it relates to the wraparound effect for 2022, it's a little bit of a math exercise. So that's just looking at \u2013 if you look at that $55 million inflation number we see in Q4, if you wrap that around for the full year based on what we've seen in 2022, you'll end up with an additional $60 million headwind for inflation. If you do the same thing for pricing and so to your point that would only include actions that we see in the P&L in Q4 2021. So that's about $30 million. If you wrap that around you get a $65 million tailwind for pricing. And that's the $5 million to $10 million that we referenced. It's kind of a pure math exercise. Just to give comfort that that's really the floor that we would see on a base case. But of course that does not contemplate pricing actions that we've taken in Q4, that have not been recognized in the P&L yet. It also assumes that inflation does not get worse. But we thought that would just be kind of a helpful gauge for what would a floor number would be."

From a revenue growth perspective EMEA has had some I would say very good tailwinds basically produced by our -- what we call our global accounts team that we've pulled together. So we've seen an aggressive build-out across Europe partially due to sovereignty, partially due to some of the Brexit activities early on and just everyone wanting data centers. So you're seeing a tremendous amount of bills happening in Europe as we speak today. That being said, the outlook as we look and look at our pipeline as I mentioned we've got pretty good views. I expect robust growth to be happening really around the globe. I expect Americas a lot of people think Americas is done and built out that is not the case. There's more data centers needed than we currently have today. And I think you'll see an acceleration of growth in 2022 for that both colo and hyperscale and as enterprise recovers. And then if you look at Asia Southeast Asia specifically they've been COVID has really slowed them down from the ability to build deliver projects. So I think when that gets unlocked you'll see a nice set of growth there. And then we commented on China earlier. I can't -- I wish I had a better crystal ball to tell exactly what was going to happen over there but we continue to see that as a good market for us. "

While we've talked about it in the past that switchgear wasn't necessarily something we had to have. As the systems get more tightly integrated as we put the controls and drive efficiency modularity which we've been talking about for a while these modular integrated data center is becoming more and more part of it. So they're excited the fact that a company of Vertiv size with our service organization which E+I didn't have a lot of service organization we can really kind of complete that entire deal for them. The bus bar category was something that we didn't really participate much in and E+I is a global leader in providing bus bar. And the excitement I would say when we talk to a lot of the global colos and hyperscale is the fact that we'll help accelerate and bring these products to all places in the world. E+I haven't really been very present at all. They don't have a factory in India, in China or rest of Asia. So the fact that they can now get global consistency, global products and the modularity side of it is a big one. E+I has done just an incredible job in Europe providing modular power skids. They've got a new facility opened in South Carolina which have been receiving orders for modular. So it gives us that capability that in some areas we do ourselves like for example in Europe Croatia. But in areas in the US, we would sub that out maybe to a third party and have them assemble our equipment and pull that together. Now we'll have that in-house capability and that core thing. So in general it wasn't anything to do with the exception of -E+I is a great company. Now it's even better with the backing of Vertiv services and Vertiv sales and Vertiv's global reach. "

Our engineering teams work diligently to qualify additional fan manufacturers to bring into our build and bring into our products. So some of the things have eased up and actually beginning to get better as we bring some new suppliers on. I would say that still neutral on where we talked about chips working with our chip manufacturers and that capacity coming online end of the year coming into Q1 Q2. Again mixed bag on what people are saying in the market. But as we talk to our suppliers there, they feel like that they'll have the capacity beginning to come on middle to the end of Q2 from that. As we think about breakers, which we all use breakers and there's a few circuit breaker manufacturers on a global basis that seems to have gotten worse from a supply perspective versus when we talked before I think -- I'm not sure that it's bottomed out but I think it probably is getting close to that from a lead time going out. And then some of the things that maybe are getting better but still spotty is the IGBTs, which we've talked about in the past and some of that was just due to the fact that COVID was affecting some of the factories in Vietnam and other parts of the world and we'll see them coming back online. So in general maybe a few parts and a little more detail here probably one of a few parts getting a little bit worse from a lead time perspective and some things improving. And again our thoughts are while we don't have a perfect crystal ball if all the things were -- being told from the supply base things should begin to get better for the second half, which we talked about for next year."

But I'll tell you that we're very excited about some of the new products that we've talked about in the past that have launched that have been received quite well. One area that I've been excited about is our thermal managing area where we continue to be a world leader and the global supplier of that. The dynamics of changing of what people want to use in the data center. While a lot of people are staying away from water we have a really good system that is waterless, very efficient that helps them drive towards their carbon neutral platform. That would be one example that we talked about in the past and we've seen a better then expected uptick of that. So people are liking the innovation, we're liking what we're bringing out. I would say in the channel side of things as well, the solutions that we've been bringing to the channel whether it's first in some of the lithium-ion battery products our Geist, kind of, our award-winning power distribution product line has had several launches that have picked up. So in general I guess I am more than thrilled with what we've delivered so far and really excited as Dave mentioned -- Cote. We continue to pull gas on the fire for innovation and we'll continue to deliver those products both in channel and in the colo, hyperscale and enterprise base. Gary?"

                "text": "All right. Yeah, hey, Andrew it's Gary. So I think in terms of your first question, the two things we do watch clearly are how is the pipeline trending and then what is our win rate by product line and by region. And for the most part pretty good visibility into both of those. Pipeline continues to accelerate particularly if I look at where we sit today versus even a year ago at this time, and then the win rates are also worst case flat maybe even a little bit better in some areas and largely due to the new product introductions that Rob talked about. So those are very much tied hand-in-hand. So for where we sit today, I think the order rate is certainly commensurate with pipeline activity increasing, as well as win rates probably even inching up versus what we would have seen a year ago."

What are we -- we're hearing a lot of stuff right? You hear hyperscalers starting to come up with proprietary technology. I think a couple of years ago, 3M was highlighting it's -- on proprietary liquid for cooling I'm not sure what happened there. There's talk about things sort of shifting from edge to the cloud and from cloud to the edge. Just big picture, what are the big themes and new exciting stuff on the horizon? And how are you guys positioned if sort of can take a longer-term view? Thank you."

                "text": "Great question. And a lot of people read into hyperscalers and what they're doing. And certainly one of the areas that the hyperscalers have spent time and innovation on is around the servers themselves the servers the storage and doing a lot of that development themselves, doing their own chips. Several have announced that. As it relates to infrastructure, we do a lot of collaboration with them. There's certainly hyperscalers, some want things down exactly the way they want them. And so we're a collaborator or provider using our IP and in some cases a mixture of joint IP but for the most part our IP. So we don't see them going in a big way, into our space as it relates to large power, large thermal but we do see them influencing our Vertiv product development as we go forward from that perspective. As it relates to technologies, which you're referring to with 3M is really their two-phase immersion cooling fluid that they've talked about and we see that really originating in bitcoin operations where there's really high-density super high density servers and immersion cooling is just yet another way to take the heat out in a high-density situation. If you think about the landscape, it will continue to evolve. And while we're involved with immersion cooling and I think I've talked about this before with the single Phase III -- II Phase we're involved in both of those as part of our R&D and we're deploying and we have partners there. I think if you think about where the industry will continue to change and evolve is one of our sweet spots and that's the thermal continue to whether it's immersion, whether it's cold plates and some cooling at the chip level all those things Vertiv's engaged with and very forward thinking on things that are going to be two to three years out. So we feel good about that. The other area that I think you'll see a focus on is generators, right? Generators is an area that creates a lot of concern and they're not looked upon as favorable for siding and so forth. So maybe alternate ways of doing tighter integration with renewables and even things such as fuel cells, which I wouldn't have thought in my lifetime would become -- began to become more mainstay. But with fuel cells and solar and wind and battery storage, those are some of the things I think if you look at the future they have been talked about by a lot of the hyperscalers and colos and certainly Vertiv with its increased R&D budgets are participating in collaboration and making sure we have a place in that game."

When we look at the numbers you're giving now on kind of November and December, taking those two months and then annualizing them, I get to kind of numbers that are significantly below what you had guided to. Any seasonality around these numbers that one month isn't equal kind of to the other as we get towards the end of the year, just seems like the contribution you're now forecasting is just a little bit light of what we were expecting around year-end or maybe they're having supply chain issues as well?"

First and foremost is probably what Rob's comments earlier alluded to in terms of site readiness. So whether that is literally getting concrete forward for some of these new sites and/or having trade labor on the other hand to be able to receive it in invoices in time. So there are some things that we're probably going to ship at the end of December that most likely are going to push to January. So there's certainly a site readiness issue would be one of them. There's a little bit of supply chain and there are no different than what we're speaking about to Rob mentioned electronic parts a few times, so they're not immune to that. So there's a little bit of that. And then maybe third is, there's a little bit of seasonality, but I think most of it is really just chalked up to primarily site readiness with a little bit of the supply chain constraints."

Vertiv is a great company and is in a really good industry. No company, no industry is ever perfect, of course, but from what I've seen over the last 8 years, I am very pleased with the company, the management team and the industry. Vertiv continues to make all of the right investments in product development in the Vertiv User Experience, in the Vertiv Operating System and many more arenas, which are all areas that will pay off more in the future than they even have to date. Truly is personifying the winning now winning later mantra that you all know is so important to me. The focus on today and tomorrow at the same time is especially true as Rob and his team focus on taking care of customers. It's an age old concept, but it sure has been proven to be true. And if you do a great job of taking care of customers, that is one of the best long-term strategies you can have. So it is costing us something to do, as you can see from the numbers, with those flat back [ph] eyes that Rob and his team have had to do to. But all of us are absolutely convinced it's the right thing to do. Taking care of customers today and tomorrow every way you can is clearly a winning strategy. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob."

                "text": "Thanks, Dave. And thanks for your guidance that you provide both to me and to my executive team in supporting Vertiv in all the ways that you do. We are better and a stronger company having you as our Executive Chairman. To all of you on today's call, thank you for being here. And I'm eager to share with you our performance for the 2021 second quarter, our outlook on the market and information about a few of our growth initiatives that we're driving at Vertiv. There are five key messages I want to convey today. And David Fallon, our CFO, will take you into a deeper dive of the financials in just a few minutes. First of all, demand for Vertiv products and services is strong. During our last earnings call, we reported first quarter sales that were up more than 22% and orders that were up 21% compared to the first quarter of last year. I am pleased to report that the sales and orders are up again in Q2. Sales were up 25% and orders were up over 24%. Having sales and orders growth in excess of 20% in the back-to-back quarters demonstrates our customer first approach and that it is paying off. In addition, our Q2 backlog rose to $2.3 billion, the highest it's ever been. Second, profitability is up. This quarter, our adjusted operating profit was $134 million, which is up $31 million or 30% from last year's second quarter. This resulted in adjusted operating margin expansion of 40 basis points. Third, year-to-date free cash flow is greater today than it was this time last year. Free cash flow for Q2 was $41 million and year-to-date, $84 million. From a year-to-date perspective, this represents an improvement of over $225 million versus the first half of 2020. Fourth, we are dealing with supply chain issues and inflation issues. We encountered supply chain challenges in Q2 and experienced commodity and freight inflation. As Dave mentioned, we made spot buys so that we can meet the delivery commitments to serve our customers and we've implemented strategies to recapture cost. Pricing always lags cost by a quarter or two, and that's exactly what we're seeing now. I have a slide coming up with more details on this. And finally, the key message, we're raising our 2021 guidance by $100 million in sales and $5 million in adjusted operating profit. This action demonstrates the confidence we have in our end markets and also reflects the priority we're placing on customer pursuit and capture. In addition, we are balancing the timing of incremental pricing coming into the P&L. Turning to page four. We've been using this slide each quarter to illustrate what we are seeing in each of our world regions and each of our end markets. As we said before, Red button indicates sluggish performance. The green button indicates strong performance, and the yellow button indicates somewhere in between. For the second quarter in a row, there are no reds. Let's take each market. Cloud and hyperscale and our colocation markets remain strong. The demand for digital applications continue to fuel the industry and is driving strong and a growing need for Vertiv products and services. In our enterprise small and medium business market, we continue to see signs of progress as it works to recover from the pandemic. We are experiencing an increase in pipeline and orders. If the current pace of activity continues in this upward trajectory, we will be able to upgrade a few of the markets that are yellow to green on our next call. The communication network stayed constant in all regions. 5G deployments and trials are continuing as are the starts and stops of customer deployments. These will provide tailwinds for us over the next few years. In the commercial and industrial market, things remain constant. While this is the smallest slice of our business, the variety of products and services we sell here continues to strengthen. All in all, the end markets we serve have remained steady. Moving on to slide five. I want to provide a little bit of color around demand as we're seeing it and give you a glimpse of two of growth investments. As mentioned earlier, overall market demand is strong, as indicated by our order rates and record backlog. This scenario led us to raise our guidance. Each of our regions saw revenue growth in the second quarter, led by continued strength in the cloud and colocation markets. Our cloud and colocation customers continue to build data centers in an aggressive but balanced fashion, and we continue to partner with them to meet the strong and growing demand. We are receiving every opportunity to capture long-term customer commitments and investing in spot buys, as Dave mentioned, to procure essential product components to take care of the delivery for our customers. Moving to the column on the right and to our growth investments, I want to talk about two specific investments. First, our IT channel business, and second, our Vertiv Product Development initiative. For the channel, our channel is growing and is part of our strategy and our growth strategy for our business. We have spent time in listening to our partners. We fine-tuned our strategy. We've built a new partner portal, developed augmented reality sales tools, added configurators, increased sales support and ramped up our digital presence in a quest to make Vertiv easy for our partners to do business with. These efforts are definitely paying dividends. Existing partnerships are being strengthened. New partnerships are being formed, and all partners are promoting Vertiv. By the numbers, we had a 50% increase in the number of resellers that are actively buying our products since this time last year. Customer base is up over 400% from Q2 of last year. A second example of how one of our growth initiatives is performing can be illustrated with this customer success story. Green Mountain is a European colocation provider. Green Mountain recently selected Vertiv as a supplier for our, as they call it, our cutting-edge technology. A key executive from Green Mountain has gone on to say the sustainability of the product and the suppliers is a key factor when purchasing new equipment. Vertiv technologies are the most efficient I've seen, and this will further improve our overall sustainability. The investments we are making in our Vertiv Product Development growth initiatives are helping us develop more cutting-edge and energy efficiency technologies for innovation, sustainability and expanding our list of customers. These are just two examples that demonstrate the progress we are making as we drive focus, resources on growth and investment areas. Moving on to slide six. Well, pricing is never easy task, but this market has required it. We are estimating having $65 million of pricing actions for the full year versus 2020. As you can see, though, by the time we get to Q4, we will have pricing that fully offset inflationary costs. Moving to the second column. Inflation is being felt by us in material, freight cost and spot buys. Approximately $60 million in materials, $15 million in freight and $35 million in spot buys. We expect the cost impacts to ramp down in 2022 driving net tailwinds. David will provide additional commentary. The third column depicts how we expect our contribution margin to evolve over the next 2 quarters. The timing of pricing versus inflation causing a dip in Q2. The pricing actions will accelerate in Q3, driving margin recovery. We anticipate full recovery by Q4 as headwinds stabilize and the pricing plan is fully implemented. And as mentioned, we're expecting a net tailwind in 2022 for this activity. So while we've experienced some short term cost impacts, pricing is coming and customer investments we are making in are in the short term and will, over the long term, continue to drive shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it over to David for a closer look at our Q2 numbers, and we'll come back at the end with some final comments. David?"

                "text": "Great. Thanks, Rob. Turning to page seven. This slide summarizes our second quarter financial results versus last year. Net sales were up $254 million or 25% and 20% when adjusted for a $50 million foreign exchange tailwind. We continued our strong momentum with second quarter orders, as Rob mentioned, which were up 24% after increasing over 20% in the first quarter. Adjusted operating profit increased $31 million or 30%, primarily driven by the profit flow through from higher sales. However, as discussed, our contribution margin in the second quarter was negatively influenced by material and freight inflation, which impacted our second quarter P&L in advance of much of the favorable pricing expected to materially benefit the second half of the year. The negative impact of net inflation on contribution margin in the second quarter was approximately $25 million with another $10 million impacting contribution margin driven by the plant inefficiencies driven by the supply chain environment. Fixed costs were up $20 million from last year's second quarter, including $30 million from last year's one-time COVID cost actions and $20 million from incremental growth in ER&D investments, both partially offset by continued fixed cost reduction initiatives and an impairment of capitalized software recognized in last year's second quarter. Our adjusted earnings per share increased $0.15 to $0.31, primarily on the strength of higher adjusted operating profit and lower interest and income tax expense. Free cash flow was down $20 million from last year's second quarter. But as we discussed in our first quarter conference call, free cash flow in the first quarter was positively impacted by $25 million due to the delay of the cash disbursement at the end of the first quarter as a result of the systems implementation. And of course, this timing also negatively impacted second quarter free cash flow by the same $25 million. Otherwise, free cash flow would have been in line with last year's second quarter. Turning to page eight. This slide summarizes our second quarter segment results. Net sales in the Americas were up $80 million or 16.5%, driven by strong double-digit growth across all three product segments. Net sales in APAC were up $75 million or 23%, with growth across most of the APAC sub-regions, product segments and market verticals. Net sales in EMEA were up $99 million or an impressive 50%, 41% organic, predominantly in the critical infrastructure and solutions products segment driven by several larger colocation projects. From a profitability perspective, adjusted operating margin declined in both the Americas and APAC, with both regions negatively impacted by material and freight inflation with Americas disproportionately impacted due to regional differences in commodity markets and higher electronic spot buys to support a larger channel business. Adjusted operating profit improved in EMEA despite inflation challenges due to the leverage benefit of lower fixed costs on a significantly higher net sales base. Once again, this demonstrates the margin benefit of maintaining or reducing fixed costs while growing the top line. You may have heard the philosophy of keeping fixed cost constant. So this is once again, a real applicable example of that. Next turning to slide nine. This chart bridges second quarter free cash flow from last year. The year-over-year benefit from higher adjusted operating profit and lower cash interest payments was more than offset by several unfavorable variances including $20 million in cash taxes driven by lower estimated payments in last year's second quarter, primarily due to COVID uncertainty. And we also had an additional $18 million outflow from inventory as we have proactively invested in inventory to satisfy customer demand in this challenging supply chain environment. Despite the unfavorable quarterly year-over-year comparison, year-to-date free cash flow is still $225 million higher than the same period last year. Last on this slide, we ended the second quarter with a record high liquidity of $1.1 billion and a record low net leverage - net debt leverage ratio of 2.2 times. Next turning to slide 10. This slide summarizes our third quarter financial guidance. We expect first half top line momentum to continue into the third quarter, with net sales up 10% at the mid-point, including a double-digit growth in EMEA and upper single digit growth in Americas and APAC. So we expect the growth momentum to continue to cross all three regions. This sales guidance assumes $25 million year-over-year benefit from pricing. And that's probably a little bit more proportionately directed at the Americas versus the other two regions. We guide towards adjusted operating profit of $160 million at the mid-point, up $92 million from last year. But as a reminder, we recognized an $80 million combined charge in last year's third quarter for restructuring and an asset impairment. This adjusted operating profit guidance assumes that the third quarter benefit from pricing does not quite offset the negative impact from inflation. However, we do anticipate a full offset pricing versus inflation in the fourth quarter. Finally, adjusted EPS is expected to increase approximately $0.23 at the mid-point, primarily driven by the $8 million restructuring and asset impairment charge in last year's third quarter, as the EPS benefits from incremental volume are offset by headwinds from net price inflation and last year's COVID actions, which were still $10 million in the third quarter of 2020. Next turning to slide 11. We summarize our revised full year 2021 financial guidance, including net sales of $5 billion, up 14% from 2020 and $100 million higher than our prior guidance. We are increasing our adjusted operating profit guidance to $600 million, up $5 million from prior guidance. And we will provide some detail of dollar increase on the next slide. We are taking down our full year estimate for adjusted operating margin by approximately 10 basis points at the mid-point. There are several moving pieces to our updated operating profit guidance, which certainly impact operating margin. Some of these are favorable; some are unfavorable as illustrated on the next slide. But in the macro, the reduction is driven by the additional net inflation and related costs, offset by fixed cost actions we have initiated, including controlling discretionary spending. For the avoidance of any doubt, we are reaffirming our adjusted operating margin targets of 16% in the intermediate term and 20% in the long term. We believe the net inflation headwind is an unfortunate 2021 dynamic due to constrained supply chains coming out of COVID. And we believe the pricing actions we are implementing today will generate a nice tailwind for 2022. And we are certainly incurring costs today to satisfy customer needs currently, and I'm referring to the spot buys and expedited freight, that we consider a long-term investment in our customer relationships, which can be referenced as winning later. Even though it is hypothetical, at least on paper without the $45 million net inflation headwinds, we could be discussing adjusted operating profit in the $645 million range for 2020 as growth remains robust, with net sales now expected to be $225 million at the mid-point higher than our beginning-of-the-year estimates. Full year adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.15, $0.04 higher than our prior full year guidance, driven by the $5 million increase in adjusted operating profit, about $0.01, and $11 million lower full year tax expense contributing about $0.03. And that was primarily the result of a discrete tax benefit that we recognized in the second quarter. Finally, we are maintaining our full year projected free cash flow guidance of $300 million, which is up almost $140 million from full year 2020. We discussed internally whether we should increase our full year free cash flow guidance, but we are holding flat due to uncertainty in the supply chain, we generally realize a really nice cash inflow in the fourth quarter from the reduction of inventory, but we want to wait another quarter to see how that plays out for this year. With that said, we do like the upper end of the range of our $290 million to $310 million free cash flow full year guidance. Next, turning to slide 12. This chart bridges our full year adjusted operating profit from prior guidance of $5 million increase. On the prior slide, we noted a $100 million net sales increase. The components of this increase include $40 million of pricing mostly in the second half, $15 million of foreign exchange translation almost entirely in the second quarter and $45 million of volume [ph] with $35 million of that in the second quarter and $10 million in the second half. The $40 million of pricing is depicted in the first green bar. The second green bar reflects the benefits of various fixed cost reduction actions we implemented in the second quarter, including controlling discretionary spending, and this should benefit the remainder of 2021. The third green bar reflects the expected flow through from the $40 million to $45 million incremental organic volume. The two largest red bars on this page reflect our updated views on the impact of supply chain challenges in 2021. This represents combined about $65 million of higher cost compared to our previous guidance with an incremental $20 million realized in the second quarter and $45 million added to the second half. Finally, on this slide, the last red bar on the right reflects expected headwinds from our prior guidance related to timing delays in productivity, both in purchasing and in the plant as a result of the current supply chain environment. With that said, I turn it back over to Rob. Rob?"

As I close, I want you to know how proud I am with the Vertiv team and what we're doing together as a one Vertiv company. We've accomplished a great first half of the year. The results we've shared today reflect the hard work and commitment of the 20,000 employees, some in the factories, some in the field and some in the offices and some still working remotely in over 130 countries around the world. As I look at the remaining months of 2021 and as we continue to invest strategically, I'm confident that we'll see above market top line growth and increase in profitability and a strengthening balance sheet. When I look down the road at 2022 and beyond, my confidence is bolstered by the conversations that I've had personally with partners and key customers about the demand, pricing and pipeline. To all employees, I'm grateful for the part you've played in the past three months and have allowed me to provide today's earnings report. Thank you for your dedication and your tireless effort to take care of our customers. To our investors, thank you for being on the call today and for your trust and support in Vertiv. It is truly my pleasure to be leading Vertiv. I will now turn the call over to the operator who will open up the line for questions."

Pricing actions were actually underway at the beginning of Q2 as we begin to see this inflationary environment. As you know, we feed a lot off of our backlog. And some of those things in our backlog, we can look at price, we can look at freight. But for the most part, as we've indicated on the call, you'll see that really kind of come to life in Q3 and Q4. So we know orders that we got in Q2 that we'll ship in Q3, Q4, Q1, we know we got price on those. So that's why we feel confident that we will get the price and we are getting the price. So that's the first thing. The second thing we've done, which has been talked about widely with industrials is the ability to get price in the channel and distribution. That's a much faster lever from that perspective. But for us, as a company compared to other industrials, we're a smaller player in that, but that's an area that we're growing fast. So we have taken pricing actions in some cases, three times within that space that will - we've seen stick, and we've seen our order growth rates, as you can see in our channels beginning to grow at the pace that we've talked about in the past. We expect to continue to take share in that space, while we continue to raise price and drive that. I don't know, any other comments, Gary or David?"

The only two other parts I'd add to your question are we do think most of the pricing that we're going to get right now is sticky. It's not going to be 100%, but the majority of that pricing should be sticky as we head into 2022. And as Rob mentioned in his opening comments, that should provide some tailwind for us throughout that next year. And then secondly, regional breakdown, I think the other part of your question was. There's a good chunk of this pricing, the majority of it that sits in Americas. So we're taking actions in all three regions. But just to your regional mix question, there certainly is a majority of the pricing that's going to happen in the Americas as well."

And we get a question asked very frequently, is this typically a build and fill, build and fill. And what we're all seeing right now is a continued build and build responsibly. The fill rates are quite high. So it gives us great confidence that we would expect to have a really good 2022."

Just to pick up a little bit more on price, I fully understand kind of the carryover impact you'd be expecting based on how you think you'll exit the year. Just wonder what the behavior is, though, if we get some deflation. Is it - has it been your experience that you can hold pricing in a modest deflationary period of time? I would assume that price comes down at lag, so you probably get some benefit from there. But just wondering about kind of the overall stickiness and as they reach kind of the new higher level on pricing?"

And if there's a deflationary environment, it would certainly take a couple of quarters to lag on the way down. But with that said, most of the actions we have implemented, we do believe are going to be pretty sticky. I mean, there is a couple of one-time type things or things that probably aren't going to carry into 2022. But for the most part, the actions we are taking are really around list prices and multipliers and discounts. And those things in our environment tend to stick around more often than not. And the other reason we feel pretty good about that is just going back to what we were able to do in '19 and '20 with pricing, both in the $20 million-ish range. That should be sort of the lowest watermark as we think about anything in a normalized state. So overall, feel pretty good about where we sit for pricing as we go into '22."

The others, it's hard to call them temporary because they're related to assumption with COVID opening up. So in our beginning of the year guidance, we anticipated that the world was going to open up in 2Q with travel and other discretionary costs, that's probably getting pushed out to the third or fourth quarter. So we're certainly going to benefit from lower discretionary costs there. But we've been able to accelerate some of the other fixed cost reductions. It's hard to quantify how much of that $30 million is going to carry over. If I were to pick a proportion, it's probably 50-50. There's probably 50% temporary, and there's probably 50% that is an acceleration of permanent things that we had in the hopper anyhow."

The way I think is the best way to understand it is if you look at the second half of the year, what we have built into our guidance is probably somewhat conservative based on what we're anticipating as continued supply chain constraints. And that could amount to anywhere between 200 to 300 basis points of growth in the back half of the year that we believe could be constrained because of the availability of parts. So if you were to dollarize that, that's in the tens of millions of dollars. So it certainly isn't insignificant. I think we've gotten some feedback that there's a belief that our top line guide in the second half is somewhat conservative. And it could be built in provision for what we think is a realistic scenario as it relates to being able to obtain parts.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it.

And it's happening pretty much to everybody. We're trying to all get after some of the same parts, whether it's fans or lithium-ion or discrete electrical components, yeah, it's pretty much across the board for everyone.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it. And then I know this might be a little tough to answer, but sort of what's the status quo price cost benefit you would receive in 2022, if you just assume fourth quarter pricing actions hold for that year and material and freight cost hold for the year at sort of fourth quarter levels?"

Effectively, the white space above each of those quarterly bars would be the opportunity - the upside opportunity from pricing. And the down potential detriment from material and freight inflation, predominantly the white space in that first quarter chart. So definitely, there's a tailwind from pricing. Don't necessarily want to quantify it for all the reasons we discussed. We're not 100% sure that it will all stick. The one thing that is clear from that chart is if - what we're seeing in the Q4 for both price and inflation continues into next year, we certainly should see a net tailwind, part of it because of the overlap of timing, the cost certainly hit us sooner this year than the benefit of pricing.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it.

But at the end of the day, what we're seeing is if you look at both the cost impact, inflation and spot buy and also the response for pricing, about 60% of what we're seeing is in the Americas. And the remainder fairly equally split between the other two regions.

But with that said, for avoidance of doubt, the net inflation certainly impacts all three regions when you get down to the adjusted operating profit line item. The other two regions, notably EMEA, probably is relatively flat in part because some of the volume increase that we included in the guidance is probably disproportionate to EMEA as well.

But certainly, the growth in that CI&S is expected to be a little bit higher than the two product segments. From a regional perspective, because the growth - the sales growth we're seeing is in disproportionate to EMEA and EMEA's contribution margins are fairly close to the Americas, so we're not necessarily seeing a negative regional mix.

But again, it's always a supply and demand thing, and we'll continue to watch that. And if they continue to creep up, then we're going to have to crack prices up and continue to do that. So we use that lever to be fair to our customers, though, we're looking to cover our cost in this environment. As far as the easing of supply, it's going to be a combination of things that are happening. Certainly, chip fabs, we're in touch with some of the largest ones that we use to understand when they get additional capacity come on. And at the end of this year, there's some capacity and then towards the middle of 2022. So once that capacity comes online, we'll feel better about the overall components chip level anyway. We do know that whether it's fans or even lithium-ion, additional capacity is being brought online and gives us comfort in the future that we'll be able to see some of those constraints ease as well. That being said, our supply chain team has been very proactive in negotiating longer term supply agreements, making commitments for supply longer than we normally would to be able to assure our supply as we get into 2022."

I believe the company said more than 20% order growth for two quarters in a row now. Maybe you could help break that down a little bit further in terms of how much is coming from growth and demand? How much is perhaps share gain? And then is there potentially a piece of this that is customers placing orders sooner than they normally would, given some of the global supply chain challenges? Thank you. "

Our plan is working, and our plan was to gain share in the colo and hyperscale space and traditionally against probably local companies that you wouldn't be aware of in various parts of the region. We've been executing quite well there and seeing those orders flip in our direction. So part of our growth is just, hey, we're taking - some share in the smaller, more regional based companies that you would recognize. I would say that, again, kind of similar thing in the channel. We've posted up some nice growth channel with our various new innovative products finding that we need to take some share there as well, and we get data on that on a monthly basis on how we're doing. So we feel good about that. What we will see, I think, and saw a little bit of going forward is people wanting to get their slotting for 2022 to assure supply because everyone is experiencing the lack of supply customer wise. So I think we'll see an acceleration of people putting just like we have on our supply base, longer term orders in place fixed and firm in order to be able to ensure that they can get their product when they need it. I don't know, any other thoughts, Gary?"

I would say that 20% of the first half growth, there's probably a pretty good chance that the market hasn't grown anywhere near that. And so I think with the latest updated guide even for the full year, we're at, what, close to 13%, 14% organic. And I think our best estimates right now is the market is probably growing maybe upper single digits, still a little fuzzy to tell exactly, but I think clearly, there's great momentum, not only there's good market - there's good market demand right now. And there's also a really good penetration happening by our sales and marketing and product development teams. And Mark, one other thing to add there that I'm super excited about, David kind of mentioned that our investments are paying off in our VPDs. And an example of that is our - one of our large cooling units that doesn't use water, innovative technology. In this area, we've been displacing other traditional technologies, maybe water cooled systems in that space. So we're seeing the investment in the R&D is ramping that and the products now coming out the door are truly innovative and allow for us to take share from that perspective. So we're very excited, lot more to come there. I know we talked about it on the last call, some of those products, but I continue to be excited in both the channel for colo, hyperscale, even our enterprise customers and Edge customers, the stuff that we've got in the pipeline and the stuff that's already hit the ground that is really aiding us and getting above market growth rate."

Is there something about how you guys hedge these costs or your assumptions around price movements that would impact that? Or maybe you're just having different volume trends in these other guys where you grew better last year? I don't know. Is there any - what's kind of the underlying assumption for that flat guidance for the second half on the commodes?"

I would say we feel pretty good with where we're locked in as it relates - in the forecast as it relates to APAC and EMEA the price increases from a steel perspective, as an example, certainly, were more pronounced in the Americas than the other two regions. So I would say if we do have uncertainty, it's related to what we're seeing in the Americas. With that said, I think what we have assumed in our forecast for Q3 and Q4 is actually slightly higher than what we're seeing currently. So even though it's below Q2, it's slightly lower than what we're seeing currently. And we've seen some stabilization in some of our input costs over the last 30 to 45 days. At the end of the day, we don't 100% know what's going to happen, but we believe we have enough of conservatism from a cost perspective built in. And the other dynamic to that is related to the spot buys. And as we mentioned, that's primarily related to electronic components, and we're certainly not unique in having that issue. That's a dynamic that we certainly believe can extend into 2022. But what we've included in the back half of the year is a combination of what we're seeing in market and also managed. So we certainly have an election whether to do a spot buy or not to do a spot buy, and we're making that decision based on a profitability algorithm, meaning we're not going to execute spot buys for every single order, but we certainly will prioritize those decisions based on what we're seeing on the demand side in the short run."

On slide nine, with respect to cash taxes and the inventory impact there, the inventory, $18 million of incremental inventory build over what I guess, what you did in 2Q '20, when should we expect to see the reversal of that back into cash flow as at some point you begin to work off the inventory build? And will we expect to see - or should we expect to see additional inventory building before we get to that point?"

                "text": "Yeah. Thanks for the question. So if you look back at our historical cash flow generation from a quarterly perspective, we certainly have a pronounced uptick in the fourth quarter. Part of that is because of the higher volume that we see. And we generally build inventory during the year and then bleed it down in the fourth quarter. So I'd say normally that dynamic happens in the fourth quarter. And as I mentioned, the reason we did not take our free cash flow full year guidance up in the current guidance is a little bit because of the dynamic of what you're questioning. So it may make strategic sense for us to continue to build inventory, notably with electronic parts as it relates to adding some insurance heading into next year. So all other things being equal, the standard answer is generally, we would see that cash flow impact in the fourth quarter. This year, we're going to wait probably till sometime at the end of the third quarter, early fourth quarter to see if it makes sense to continue that inventory investment."

So our estimated cash tax payments in the second quarter of 2020 were probably artificially low based on our actual profits we were seeing on a year-to-date basis and also our expectations for the full year. So that's just the timing issue. I'll probably take this opportunity to maybe talk a little bit about the tax impact on the P&L. So we did take our full year income tax expense down about $10 million, $11 million for the full year. If you look at our tax expense, in Q2, we guided closer to 2021, and our expense was actually about $1 million. So that's a $20 million P&L benefit. That's not necessarily tied to this $20 million cash variance just for clarity there. But half of the $20 million P&L benefit was related to some legal entity restructuring we did in - outside the US. That's a permanent benefit. The other $10 million was related to the ASC 740 accounting. So it's purely timing based. And a lot of that was unfortunately driven by the accounting we have to do for warrants, which pushed a lot of net $10 million expense in Q3 and probably more significantly in Q4. So probably more than what you're asking for from a tax perspective, but I thought there may be a question out there on that."

On a gross basis, gross leverage is probably 3.3 times, and we had about $700 million of cash on our balance sheet at the [Technical Difficulty] that's what takes you down to the 2.2, but we don't see that $700 million as burning a hole in our pocket. So as we kind of mentioned, if you look at our priorities, we'll continue to pay down debt, but we certainly would like to use our balance sheet to look at some strategic acquisitions. And when we started this journey about 18 months ago, our net leverage was net 6 to 6.5 times. We were 4 times when we SPAC. And sitting at 2.2 times feels a lot better. We have always talked about probably a comfortable long-term range is in that 2 to 3 times. But with that said, we would certainly be comfortable getting above 3 times for the right deal. And we also would feel comfortable getting below 2 times if that right deal was not available. But from a prioritization perspective, we'll continue to pay down debt with certainly look at accretive strategic acquisitions. And if we're in a position we have to do something from a dividend perspective or a share repurchase perspective, we'll look at that when the time comes."

So that gives us some excitement about where it's going. We want to see that continue through Q3. And if we do, then you'll see that turn to green in terms of the buying, it is back. I would say, as we think about some of the hotter verticals right now in the enterprise area, it's certainly health care spending, education spending, some areas still kind of restrictions [ph] the travel. We certainly see financial institutions spending. So beginning we're post-COVID, but we've got this in-out thing still going on. We had talked about in previous calls that we have seen a lot of quote activity, a lot of engineering activity, and that is now being turned and placed into orders for us in the enterprise space.

We're expanding those tools as we've talked in the past, throughout Europe and then Asia. So this will continue to be a muscle that will flex and grow and get more and more mature and use more data analytics to drive it. So we continue to believe that pricing will be one of those levers that will continue to drive for years to come. But I feel good about where we're at. I feel good about the methodologies that we have and the ability to get that and really stemmed from a couple of years ago when we first started it, and we just continue to drive that.

Certainly, with some of the new products that we've talked about the thermal management side and even some of the power management stuff and certainly channel, we feel like we have sustainable gain share there happening and we'll continue to see that momentum.

And at the end of the day, we target growth regardless of what the comps are. But we do because of the dynamics of what we saw with COVID in the first half of last year, notably in Q2. Some of those sales were pushed in the back half of the year. And notably the fourth quarter of last year, it creates a challenging comp. So that's number one. Number two is, as we mentioned, there's probably a little bit of cushion or buffer or conservatism, however you want to describe it, built into what we're seeing as it relates to our expectations of sales that we won't necessarily be able to deliver because of some of the supply chain constraints. And I think if you look at the - from a quarterly perspective, I think it's 8% organic growth in Q3, 4% in Q4. We believe what we're guiding to is certainly is a very doable number, and we hope there's some upside."

                "text": "Thanks, Lynne. This is now the fifth quarter we've reported as a public company, and I think you can see what I've seen and talked about this entire time. This really is a great company in a really good industry with multiple ways to continue improving the top and bottom line.  Rob and his team, as you can see, are making great progress with new products, global growth and the process initiatives like the Vertiv operating system, Vertiv product development, customer view and functional transformation. And these process initiatives show that there are lots of barriers to improve upon, and Rob and the team are focused on those. But I think you'll also agree with me that the first quarter results sure are something to be proud of and provide us a great start to the year.  So with that, I'll turn it over to Rob."

                "text": "Thanks, Dave. Thank you for your guidance that you provide to me and the executive team and the support for Vertiv that you always have given. We really appreciate it.  To all of you on today's call, thank you for being here, and I'm eager to share more about our performance for the first quarter, our outlook for the market and give you a glimpse of a few new products Dave just talked about that our talented and innovative teams at Vertiv have developed.  Turning to Slide 3. There are 5 key messages I want to convey today, and we'll share them at a high level, and David will elaborate more on the financial details in just a few minutes. First, I'm pleased to report sales were up more than 22%, and orders were up 21% versus Q1 of 2020. Growth happened in all regions across all major verticals, and we ended the quarter with a record high backlog of $2.1 billion.  Second, from a profitability standpoint, our adjusted operating profit was $112 million, which is up $92 million or 450% from last year's first quarter. This resulted in adjusted operating margin expansion of over 790 basis points, driven by higher sales and lower fixed cost on a percentage basis.  Third, our free cash flow at the end of Q1 was $43 million, an improvement of $246 million, made possible by higher earnings and lower interest expense.  Fourth, the market is facing supply chain and commodity cost challenges, and Vertiv is not exempt. We are aggressively working to secure supply needed so that we can provide on-time delivery to our customers, first and foremost, while developing and executing strategies to share the cost with our customers where possible. Because supply chain constraints, coupled with inflation, we will see some incremental unexpected costs over the short term.  And fifth, and the final key message, we are raising our 2021 sales guidance by $125 million, such that the new sales guidance is between $4.8 billion and $4.9 billion. And raising our adjusted operating profit guidance by $20 million. So our operating guidance is now $585 million to $605 million.  This demonstrates our confidence in the end markets and the confidence in our teams all across Vertiv to perform in accordance with our strategy and to meet the growing needs of our customers. Let me elaborate on these 5 key points using the next few slides.  Turning to Slide 4. We've been using this slide quarter-to-quarter to talk about our end markets and illustrate activity in each of our regions around the world. A red button on the slide indicates sluggish performance. A green bucket -- green button indicates strong performance. And a yellow button indicates something in between. Cloud and hyperscale and colocation markets have been very strong and remain strong across all regions. The demand for digital applications, online education, telemedicine, video and gaming is booming, benefiting our cloud and colocation customers and driving a strong and growing need for Vertiv products and services around the world.  In our enterprise, small and medium business market, we're seeing signs of improvement as well. Our 2 reds have now turned yellow, but it's still not clear when the entire enterprise segment will open up. We are, however, encouraged to see things moving in the right direction.  The communication networks market stayed constant in Americas and EMEA. It improved in APAC over the quarter, and we were able to see a shift in the market from yellow to green. Americas and APAC are performing strongly in this segment. Americas activity is driven by several large U.S. telecom carriers and the continued rollout of 5G.  In the commercial and industrial market this quarter, EMEA has shifted from red to yellow. And because of that, we are now showing solid yellows across all regions, indicating some positive movement in the commercial and industrial space.  All the end markets we serve are good -- are in very good shape now, as illustrated by the rays of yellows and green across the slide for Q1.  Digital applications continue to increase their importance in everyday life. There's no -- they're no longer nice to have but a necessity for individuals and for businesses. The increasing need means there's an increasing demand for the processing, storage and transmission of data, which creates significant opportunity for Vertiv, and we are perfectly poised to go after that opportunity.  Moving to Slide 5. I'd like to make a few comments regarding supply and demand. As I mentioned earlier, the overall market demand is strong, as evidenced by our order rates and backlog, which has resulted in us raising guidance. Each of our regions saw revenue growth in the first quarter, led by continued strength in cloud and colocation markets. Our cloud and colocation customers continue to build data centers in an aggressive but balanced fashion, and we will continue to partner with them to meet the strong and growing demand.  We continue to stay vigilant around COVID, keeping our employees, our customers and our partners safe wherever they are in the world. That is our main priority. We have made adaptations where necessary and have found solutions to business challenges brought on by COVID. We remain confident in our ability to serve our customers and meet their needs. Yet, similar to other companies, we are facing some supply chain issues due to market conditions.  There are a couple of things that are going on here. First, we find ourselves dealing with some parts shortages and materials. For the most part, we've identified solutions for those. Second, like many other companies, we are seeing cost increases on both material and the logistics side. This is being tracked and managed and closely monitored, and we are taking actions to offset the increased costs.  But nonetheless, this is a short-term headwind. We've been planning to implement some footprint optimization programs. We have pivoted and decided to delay some of those programs to take advantage of the strong demand environment. The footprint optimization plan will be executed, but it will happen a little bit later than originally expected.  Moving to Slide 6. I've talked to you in the past about our Vertiv product development process, VPD, and you all know about the allocations and resources we have made to research and development. So I wanted to show you a few of the new products. I can't tell you how thrilled I am with the progress that's being made in our engineering teams and all those that are responsible for executing our strategy to innovate, design and build products for the future.  Here are some early results on this slide. The first product, shown in the upper left, will formally be launched tomorrow, and it's another way that we're helping our customers to become more efficient and provide lower carbon offerings. It is a grid interactive UPS, which will allow data center operators to use the UPS to power their data center and during low power times, to inject power back into the grid to drive the efficient use of data center equipment.  On the upper right is the newest addition to our thermal offerings. We continue to innovate in the thermal space to drive more efficiencies and to provide best solutions for our customers. This product provides liquid cooling for high-density servers and racks, providing customers with an efficient way to cool their high-density applications.  Finally, on the bottom of the chart, you will see 2 of our new edge offerings. The product on the lower left is a small UPS that's very efficient, very compact and utilizes the latest in lithium battery technology for longer time back -- for longer backup time. The product on the lower right is our newest single rack data center, which includes integrated UPS, power distribution, thermal management and our secure switch. This is a preconfigured solution and is a great example of the type of product we are bringing to the market for distributed IT and new edge applications.  I really could talk hours about the research and development at Vertiv, but wanted to highlight a few of the new products so you can understand how we're focusing our R&D efforts and allowing us to bring these innovative solutions and offerings to our customers into the market.  With that, I'll turn it over to David for a closer look at the Q1 numbers and come back at the end with some final comments. David?"

                "text": "Great. Thanks, Rob. First, turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our first quarter results versus last year. Net sales were up $201 million or 22.4%, 19.5% when adjusted for a $26 million foreign exchange tailwind. We continued our strong momentum with orders, which were up 21% in the first quarter after increasing 10% in full year 2020. Adjusted operating profit increased $92 million or over 450%, primarily driven by the profit flow-through from the higher sales and the benefit from SPAC transaction costs in last year's first quarter, all translates into a 790 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin.  Adjusted EPS at $0.21 is $0.86 higher than last year, driven by the improved operations and a $0.54 benefit from the $174 million loss on extinguishment of debt and $21 million of SPAC transaction costs in last year's first quarter. Our sales and profitability performance converted into strong free cash flow of $43 million, $246 million higher than last year's first quarter, and we will review some of the drivers of this improved free cash flow in a couple of slides.  So turning to Page 8. This slide summarizes our first quarter segment results. Net sales in the Americas were up $35 million or 7.5%, driven by growth -- strong growth with hyperscale customers in our critical infrastructure and solutions product segment. Net sales in APAC increased $133 million or 60%, in part due to an approximate $50 million COVID impact on sales in last year's first quarter, but we otherwise experienced strong growth across most APAC subregions and market verticals, including data centers, telecom and commercial and industrial. Net sales in EMEA were up $33 million or 16%, predominantly in the critical infrastructure and solutions product segment, driven by several larger colocation projects. From a profitability perspective, adjusted operating margin improved across all 3 regions, primarily due to the leverage benefit of relatively flat or lower fixed costs on significantly higher net sales in each region, providing a practical example of the potential margin benefit of maintaining fixed cost constant while growing the top line.  Next, turning to Slide 9. This chart bridges first quarter free cash flow from last year. The $246 million increase is primarily a result of higher adjusted operating profit, lower cash interest payments and improved trade working capital in addition to a $21 million year-over-year benefit from SPAC cash transaction costs last year. The $43 million of free cash flow in the quarter was higher than our internal expectations, primarily driven by the timing of a cash disbursement of approximately $25 million at the end of March due to a system implementation. So we anticipated that cash outflow to occur at the end of March, actually occurred at the beginning of April. Although it does not impact free cash flow, we received $107 million at the beginning of the first quarter, pursuant to the final public warrant redemptions. And this certainly facilitated a record-high liquidity of $1.1 billion and a record-low net debt leverage ratio of 2.3x at the end of the first quarter.  Next, turning to Slide 10. We wanted to address the change related to the accounting for our warrants. Last week, we issued a press release and filed an 8-K providing more detail on this matter. But pursuant to new guidance released by the SEC on April 12, we changed the historical and prospective accounting for both our public and private warrants to record a liability for the fair value of these warrants. And with any subsequent change in fair value, adjusting the liability and recording a noncash nonoperating gain or loss in the P&L. When our stock price increases, the liability increases and we record a noncash loss. When our stock price declines, the liability declines, and we record a noncash gain.  As a result of this change, we will file an amended 2020 10-K in the coming days, reflecting these changes, including recognizing additional noncash nonoperating expense of approximately $144 million in fiscal year 2020 as our stock price increased significantly during the year. We also recognized a $14 million noncash loss in the first quarter. This warrant gain or loss is recorded below operating profit, and it will not impact any of our non-GAAP operating metrics, including adjusted operating profit, adjusted EPS and free cash flow.  So next, turning to Slide 11, looking forward. This page summarizes our second quarter financial guidance. We expect first quarter top line momentum to continue in the second quarter, with net sales up 20% at the midpoint, with strong growth across all 3 regions. And our second quarter sales is also expected to be up 10% sequentially from the first quarter. We guide towards adjusted operating profit of $125 million at the midpoint, up 21% from last year despite a $30 million headwind from one-off COVID cost actions in last year's second quarter and a $25 million increase in year-over-year growth in R&D investments.  Adjusted operating margin is expected to be relatively flat, with contribution margin percentage slightly lower than last year due to commodity and logistics inflation. And despite higher year-over-year dollar fixed costs due to last year's COVID actions and incremental investment spending this year, fixed cost as a percentage of sales should be slightly lower. Finally, adjusted EPS is expected to increase approximately $0.07 or 44% at the midpoint, driven by the higher adjusted operating profit and lower interest expense.  Next, turning to Slide 12. We summarize our revised full year 2021 financial guidance, including higher net sales expectations to $4.9 billion, up 12% from 2020 and $125 million higher than our prior guidance, $60 million of that from the first quarter and -- or $60 million in the first quarter and $65 million over the remainder of the year based on our strong first quarter order performance and backlog. We are increasing our adjusted operating profit guidance to $595 million, up $20 million from prior guidance, and we will provide some detail of this increase on the next slide, including quantifying the expected net financial impact of the commodity and freight headwinds, as Rob discussed. Full year adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.11, $0.07 higher than our prior full year guidance, driven by higher projected -- adjusted operating profit, about $0.05 there, and lower interest expense from our first quarter term loan refinancing, about $0.02. Finally, we are increasing our full year projected free cash flow to $300 million, up $15 million from our prior guidance of $285 million.  Turning to Slide 13. This chart bridges our full year adjusted operating profit from prior to current guidance, a net increase of $20 million, with a favorable $35 million coming from an incremental $125 million of net sales, however, converting at a rate lower than our average contribution margin due to product mix and higher marginal manufacturing costs, including expedited freight in some cases as we manage our capacity to meet the higher customer demand. Partially offsetting these volume benefits is a $15 million net headwind, including $25 million in commodity and freight inflation, approximately $15 million from commodities and $10 million from freight, both disproportionately impacting the Americas. This cost inflation is partially offset by an assumed $10 million of incremental pricing. And we believe there is further opportunity for additional incremental pricing as we progress through the year.  With that said, I turn it back over to Rob."

                "text": "Well, thanks, David. Overall, I'm very proud of the Vertiv team and what we've accomplished since becoming public. We've been executing our strategy, as Dave Cote has alluded, whether it's the VOS or the product development, all the levers we've talked about, and we feel really good about the next 2, 3 years as we continue to execute that strategy. I believe our results for this quarter have demonstrated the hard work and the effort of the 20,000 employees we have around the world.  As I look into the balance of 2021, we continue to anticipate above market top line growth and increase in profitability and a strengthening balance sheet, all while continuing to invest in the strategic areas, as we've talked about, R&D and sales and marketing.  To all the employees on the call today, thank you again for your dedication and your tireless effort to take care of our customers.

                "text": "Rob, last quarter, you had mentioned that you thought order growth could sustain in the high single-digit range, but obviously, in Q1, you reported low 20% order growth. So maybe give us a little more color into what was the incremental upside versus your expectations. Was it more continued hyperscale and colo outperformance? Or was it an enterprise beginning to come back? And has your order outlook improved for the next few quarters where you can sustain more of this double-digit type order growth?"
            },
            {
                "speaker": "Robert Johnson",
                "text": "Yes. Great question. And you're absolutely dead on with the colo and hyperscale. Typically, those don't fall into our flow rate business. So those orders come when they come. And we look them in the pipeline, but when they want to release them. And typically, we'll get those orders anywhere from 3, 6, 9 months in advance of deploying those. And what we've seen certainly is a tightening market and longer potential lead times. And I think as we look at the global build-out continue, it's just stronger than we necessarily expected and probably saw people making sure they get in line to get their supply going forward.  So -- but I'm encouraged going forward, and you've seen -- I know a couple of others have released today, Google and Microsoft. And we're seeing strong and continue to see strong growth there on a global basis. So I'm positive to that. And as I mentioned earlier in the call or in my script I was going through, we are seeing signs of really good life in the enterprise. We'll see when that fully turns back on, and that could be additive as we watch that come back to life."

                "speaker": "Andrew Kaplowitz",
                "text": "And then Dave, can you give us a little more color into the Q2 guide in the sense that you actually forecast Q2 sales to be up $100 million versus Q1, but adjusted operating margin at the midpoint looks relatively similar. So I think you said fixed costs would be lower as a percentage of sales versus a year ago in Q2. But what does that metric look like versus Q1? And what are the headwinds sequentially? Maybe FX not as good? Do you dial in more negative [indiscernible] cost and higher investment spend? Maybe you could go over the pieces for us a little bit, that would be helpful."
            },
            {
                "speaker": "David Fallon",
                "text": "Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question, Andy. So if you look at the components sequentially, so Q1 adjusted operating profit was $112 million. We're guiding $125 million, so $13 million increase. We do anticipate to see a straight pass-through from a profit perspective on the higher sales. I think sales are up $110 million or so sequentially. We do expect to see a 40% drop there -- on those additional sales. So we don't see any negative impact from a contribution margin percentage perspective in Q2 versus Q1.  Really, a little bit of a drag quarter-over-quarter Q2 from Q1 is on the fixed cost side. So we anticipate probably about $20 million of higher fixed costs in Q2 versus Q1. And a lot of that is driven by the timing of R&D and growth investments. And in fact, we had planned $10 million of R&D and growth investments in the first quarter, and a good portion of that actually slipped into Q2 because of the timing of hiring and the launching of a few projects.  But the other element that has an impact sequentially is the annoying FX gain and loss dynamic. So we had a $7 million FX transaction gain in the first quarter. Based on the weakening of the euro at the end of the quarter, the euro has since recovered from 1 17 up to close to 1 21. So we probably have about a $10 million headwind from that FX transaction gain/loss dynamic in Q2 versus Q1.  So all that flushes out relatively flat adjusted operating margin right around 10.2%, 10.3%. But as a result of the timing of some of the fixed costs, the actual dollar increase in adjusted operating profit is probably lighter than what some expectations are."

                "text": "Yes. Thanks, Mark. This is David. I'll start, and Rob and Gary can add on. So yes, we called out an additional $15 million, and this is current guidance versus prior guidance as it relates to these additional mix and incremental manufacturing costs.  From a product perspective, if you look at our product segments, our critical infrastructure and solutions product segment is a relatively lower margin than the other 2. And some of that -- or a good portion of the $125 million incremental sales are in that product segment. And so if you look at incremental, $15 million probably, half of that is related to that product mix. The other half is related to satisfying the demands of our customers.  So I mentioned in my comments, we have -- in order to meet customer demands, in certain cases, we've had to enlist expedite freight. In addition, we have ramped up our capacity in some of our facilities, including adding shifts and temporary labor. And as a result, some of these marginal incremental sales are coming in at a little bit lower contribution margin than we would otherwise anticipate.  We would expect -- these additional manufacturing costs certainly will be temporary. We do have a long-term capacity planning project that is ongoing, which will support the higher growth, and we believe we'll be able to transition away from a lot of these higher incremental costs in the second half of the year. So a lot of this incremental cost that we're seeing, we do anticipate in the second quarter."

I mean, there's been really good progress reducing debt, lowering your interest expense. And the opportunity has been discussed at some point in the future. Perhaps the company could return to doing some tuck-in M&A or perhaps even a larger-scale M&A, which there's been some success with historically. I know there's a few acquisitions the company has been pretty happy with. And I think investors are interested in what potential there may be to do that type of acquisitions going forward.

As Dave Cote has always said, opportunities and -- present themselves, not necessarily in timing, not when you want them to. And so we continue to work through that list and keep those type relationships and have eyes on things.  As we've talked about before, it's always been about deleveraging first, and I think we've done a pretty good job doing that and have ourselves in a pretty good position to do some things if the opportunity positions itself. And we are actively -- always actively looking, but nothing that's imminent that we can talk about today. David?"

So to get that down closer to 2 really demonstrates the free cash flow DNA of this business, and it absolutely provides us the flexibility to be strategic with our balance sheet. We certainly don't have a strategy to do a deal because we think we need to do a deal, but we will be patient. And we certainly have the flexibility to do something relatively quickly if the right opportunity arises."

Although I've been talking for a couple of quarters, the thing that gives me the comfort that it will is the quoting activity and the level of quotes.  So I would say that as we see the enterprise turn from yellow to green, certainly, there's potentially some upside from that perspective. But I would say, in general, we continue to see the strength in the colo and the hyperscale.

We have talked about in our strategy that we want to get to about 6% overall of -- for R&D. And so we've seen some ratchets up over the last couple of this year and last year and even next year to get to that 6%. And we plan on kind of holding it at that just based on the need, right? Really, what we're doing is taking a look at the funnel of projects, the collaboration that's needed by our customers, and doing what we need to do to really drive innovative solutions that will help us outpace the market growth and take share as we go forward.  Certainly, there's not a lack of activities that we believe we can do to create more value for our customers and ultimately more value for the share owners. But as you think about it going forward, you think about it getting to about a 6% level, and we think that will be sufficient with the growth rate that we're going to have, which would give us additional R&D dollars every year, just holding it at 6%. Now David, any other thoughts?"

And to Rob's point on R&D, last year, we spent $230 million on R&D, add another $35 million this year, that's $265 million. And based on the most recent top line guidance, that's 4.5% to 5%. So to get to 6%, there's certainly going to be some additional step changes over the next couple of years. And of course, the dollar amount also increases, all other things being equal, just with the top line increasing.  And the one thing I can tell you is that this is not a capital rationing exercise. There are plenty of projects out there. So there is an efficiency and productivity perspective. You can only do so many. So there, the ability to increase this dollar spend, we're not chasing the last dollar. So there is plenty of opportunity for us to continue to invest. And all of these projects have really, really good returns, and that probably was the first question. And that payback period is anywhere from 12 to 24 months, depending on the specific project."

We don't provide guidance as it relates to a product segment perspective, and we can give some color on that. But certainly, from a regional perspective, if you look at Q2 this year versus last year and the 17% expected organic growth, give or take, that's going to be pretty strong across all 3 regions. So probably low single digits in the Americas, and in both APAC and EMEA, somewhat over a 20% growth. So this is not a situation -- the reason we mentioned that is this is not a situation where we anticipate another 40% or 50% growth in one region and all the other 2 regions are single digits. So we're expecting strong growth in Q2 across all 3 regional segments.  Now when you look at first half versus second half, and all the numbers are out there, so everybody can do the math. It certainly does imply lower organic growth in the second half of the year. So organic growth in the first half of between 15% and 20%, that would imply low single digits in the second half of the year. What we can tell you is we did not expect that low single-digit to be uniform in Q3 and Q4. We do anticipate Q3 from a percentage growth perspective to be higher than the year-over-year growth that we see in Q4. So Q4, last year, if you recall, presents a very, very challenging comp, right? We had sales over $1.3 billion, including exceptional sales in EMEA based on the timing of some larger projects and also APAC.  So there could be some conservatism built into our guidance in the fourth quarter. We just don't have the visibility at this point to really lean forward too much on Q4. And we do anticipate that to have more information related to orders and pipeline when we update our guidance in Q2."

I think we're getting pretty good at doing that. When we've had times before where freight costs have gone up like they have been, we've been able to institute surcharges. Sometimes that's lagging, and I mentioned a few -- in some of my comments, some of the lagging to pick that up. And then based on contracts and orders, working with our customers, everyone understands that commodity prices are going up, steel is doubled, that type of thing.  Our customers are pretty good about working with us and going through that. Certainly, we're able to go forward price things at that higher cost rate. And we're able to get that. So we feel good. We have $10 million, I think Dave showed in his bridge, of incremental additional pricing this year. While that's something we're striving for, we think we could probably do better than that. But based on what we see, based on where we're at, that's kind of what we built into our plan.

What we are seeing early signs of is people upgrading their closets as they drive more to cloud and colo, upgrading their network closets, refurbishing old gear, certainly where there's old batteries and that type of thing.  So certainly, when it goes to bright green, we would expect to see probably stronger than traditional growth in that enterprise because there's been -- and the reason I say that is we see the quoting activity. We see what's happening at the engineering side of things. And we do believe when that frees up, I don't know if it all happens overnight or it's a slow, kind of like we saw in this last quarter, slowly easing back into it. I mean I think a lot of it's going to be determined around what happens with the back to work with COVID vaccine, which we can't predict. But I think those things can be correlated and tied to people saying, I feel good about spending again. When people are back in the office, they're used to this level of service at home now.

One is, first quarter in Americas for service was down a little bit primarily because of 2 main issues. One is, if you remember, we had those horrible storms that rolled through most of the U.S., a lot of it in the Southeast and Texas area. So that prevented some site access and pushed some jobs out a little bit. The other portion of it was we have a decently large commercial and industrial service business in the U.S., and that was lagging just because a lot of that is vectored towards utilities, oil and gas, which obviously were depressed from an order standpoint last year. So that business is coming back online. Now we see really pretty strong order rates there, number one. Two, clearly, the weather issue is temporal and that is behind us. So we would expect to see acceleration in that service business, particularly in the Americas as the year goes on."

Maybe you could just elaborate a little bit more on that particular product and anything else interesting in the pipeline."

So when we get -- where we are in the belief, the good interaction, we've actually had pilots going for months and even over a year over in Europe, where we'll do that kind of sharing model, revenue-sharing model with the utility where you'll go on battery and inject power back on the grid and/or just free up power for the grid. So there's a couple of different revenue-sharing models there. So as we get more sophisticated and people realize that, hey, it's still reliable infrastructure, even though you're on battery and people get more comfortable with that, we think that, that grid -- and in order to -- the grid interaction is going to play a big part of it. In order for people to drive more carbon friendly, they're going to have to be doing those types of things as well. So we see that and interacting with the grid, whether it's behind-the-meter storage or in front of the meter. And I talked about this before as an area, an adjacency and a growth area as we go forward. So as it relates to -- we'll continue to focus, as we've talked about in the past, thermal management requires -- draws most of the utility expense within a data center, and we continue to drive more efficient, effective solutions, utilizing software controls, AI around that. So we expect to see things like that in the future from us that will just drive that and helping that carbon get to that carbon neutral position."

We've got some pilots. I think a bigger part of the collaboration is us working together globally and bringing Honeywell into areas that they necessarily haven't been into with their software offering, which is a very, very robust offering, along with our equipment and to drive more efficiency as we go through the data center. So we are -- the teams are working together globally and expect -- this isn't something that happens overnight, but expect over time, you'll see more and more of kind of the Honeywell-Vertiv solution showing up in data centers driving -- and really driving efficiency and then joint collaborating on customers they may have, but we aren't currently doing business with and vice versa."

On Slide 13, where you lay out the bridge and focusing on the cost pressures and sourcing and so forth, you show the $10 million kind of recovery from passing price-throughs and this $25 million hit from commodity and logistics headwinds. And I guess my question is, how are those 2 numbers related? In other words, if it turns out that the commodity and logistics turns out to be maybe a $50 million headwind, should we assume that you can pass on perhaps $20 million of the costs? Are they variable in that way? Or no, is it sort of like a hard stop? You think it's going to be tough to pass on more than $10 million so we just need to hope that the impact from the logistics isn't much greater than that? Could you comment on that?"

                "text": "Yes, Lance, this is David. I'll start, and Gary and Rob can jump in. I would definitely say the two are correlated, right? The higher the commodity logistics headwind and inflation is, the more data we have and to reasonably take price up consistently with competitors, right? So there's definitely a high correlation. The one thing that we're seeing here is that there's generally a lag. So we will see the negative impact from commodity and logistics sooner in our costs, then we do have the ability to pass that through for higher pricing. Now one thing that we did see, which turns this into somewhat of a positive, the last time we saw significant commodity and logistics headwinds, what we found is that the pricing is actually a little bit sticky upwards. So we actually look at this strategically as a way to get additional price. And then if the commodity and logistics headwinds abate at some point this year or even early next year, generally, the pricing that we see remains where it's at. There's always some give and take. But on the way up, that pricing opportunity is certainly going to be correlated with the headwinds we're seeing. And the other thing that I probably want to point out on this slide and remind folks is that this is versus prior guidance. So this is the overlay for additional commodity and logistics headwinds versus our beginning of the year assumptions. If you looked at this for a full year, we had about $20 million of headwinds for commodity and freight inflation in that beginning of the year guidance. So if you add the $20 million and the $25 million, you get about $45 million. We also had assumed about $15 million of pricing in that prior guidance as well. So full year pricing expectations are now right around $25 million. And if there is additional inflation, we do believe there's opportunity to take those pricing assumptions up as well."

The implication for margin is that there'd be about $35 million favorable year-over-year variance in the second half, and that offsets about $20 million unfavorable variance in the first half. So the reason you see favorability in the second half is because of the timing of some of these initiatives. We do assume that pricing will ramp up as we go through the year. So the $25 million in total, there's probably a relatively small number in the first quarter, and that will ramp up as we go through the year, in addition to our productivity opportunities. And a lot of those are around the purchasing side, completely independent from price. And though as well ramp up as we go through the year. So -- and almost sequentially.

So I think everybody anticipates that it can't get much worse from a steel pricing perspective, which is our most exposed commodity. But I guess it could.

But if you look at individual quarters, it likely is not going to be a significant player from a -- from a product perspective, we do believe that, I think in the first quarter, the critical infrastructure and solutions business was probably 50% of our total business last year. I think that ramped up closer to 60% in Q1. We don't see a similar dynamic through the remainder of the year, but as we're seeing, some of the additional sales we added to our guide are skewed a little bit more to that CI&S.

We're really focused on our innovative solutions that we're bringing to market, our thermal management and kind of that total solutions approach in the channel, which we think globally, we've got a really good position and strong there.  So while not necessarily focused on Tripp Lite and Eaton, what's going on there, we're really focused on bringing those new products to market and driving innovation against our competitors to gain share. And as you can see in our IRS business, we did have decent year-over-year growth. We've seen that for the last several quarters now and expect to continue to see that grow as we introduce more products into that venue. And not all IRS business is in the channel. So it's not necessarily indicative of the channel because we do sell -- the C&I business as well falls within that channel space."

I mean if you think you have technology-focused global business, it does seem if you look at the legislative action, there are pretty big bills cooking up in Congress in regards to China, in regards to incentivizing technology R&D -- technology and R&D investment in the U.S. And it was your philosophy to optimize your existing manufacturing footprint, right, and just drive high and higher volume. Does this sort of change your thinking, the sort of bifurcation of the tech world perhaps into, I guess, President Biden uses the term techno-democracies and techno-autocracies. Have you guys thought about it? Does it change your approach to manufacturing footprint, your sourcing? A pretty open-ended question, but it seems there are sort of big headlines, at least, coming on this topic and you guys in the middle of it, just given what you do for a living."

                "text": "Andrew, thank you for your question. I don't think it really changes. We're a little bit different than maybe some of our competitive -- companies out there have always been kind of more or less an in country-for-country or an in region-for-region. What we did do over the last couple of years from an R&D perspective is really drive to a matrix and put center of excellence all over the world, not necessarily in best cost locations, but in the right place to be developing those products. So I think you'll find both our R&D investments, which are pulling full in the U.S. and in the Americas and in Europe and in Asia Pac, and I think you'll find that fairly balanced. And so we were already doing that. I think COVID has taught us a lesson about second sourcing vendors and making sure that we have more in region, and we've made some moves based on COVID to be even more regional from that perspective, which probably plays in the hands of some of the stuff Biden is doing. But in general, I don't think that's driving our thoughts right now. But I feel really comfortable with the footprint we have from a development perspective. And as we look at how we do things, we're, in some cases, a highly-engineered product, and freight and everything is important in speed to market is important. So being closer to our customers, not just using an Asian source and bringing that in, it has been part of our strategy and will continue to be that."

You covered that very well. So I'm not going to retread any new ground here. But 20 bps of additional price doesn't seem like a shoot-for-the-moon scenario, but how does the backlog play into the pricing equation for the second half of the year? You've got $2.1 billion of backlog, it's about 2 quarters worth of sales, not quite 2 quarters. But are we thinking here that the price increases are mainly in the fourth quarter, given that backlog coverage? Or is there some mechanism in the backlog to push through some digital price?"

                "text": "Yes. Nigel, it's Gary. So I'd say the answer is mixed and varied. I mean obviously, it's a little bit easier to get price on new orders. But by no means are we just taking a look at that $2 billion of backlog and saying, well, there's nothing we can do. It's already in backlog. So we do have some other mechanisms, sometimes in larger contracts that have material clauses in them. Certainly, freight is another lever that we can utilize. That is a real-time mechanism. There's been times when we've instituted surcharges as well. So I would say that, yes, it's easier to get price on new orders coming through the door. But by no means are we going to just discount the $2 billion that we have and say there's nothing we can do there. We're looking at that, taking action on that as well. With all that said, I do think price probably continues to ramp throughout the year, as David mentioned earlier. So I think in general, that pricing will ramp. But those are the different ways we're looking and trying to execute that pricing and freight scenario."

It's always double-digit growth and strong growth but there's no quantification. So I'm just curious, obviously, you see the bids and quotes in the RT activity. How do you feel your share is tracking relative to the last 2 or 3 or 4 months? And where do you think you're gaining or even losing share?"

And one thing I think all of us on the call need to remember is, typically, people talk about a couple of the big 3 or 4, but as you look at the pie charts we've shared in the past, there's a lot of gray area, which is smaller, more regional players that play into this from that perspective. So you got to be careful just watching us versus some of the other competitors that are our size and really look at how we think about things, and part of our strategy was taking share from those more local mom and pop, where we failed to innovate early on or provide a solution and now can provide a solution and provide that globally. So I think we feel -- across the board, we feel really good about where we're at from a thermal position and from a power position as well. And again, you'll have some local players that we go up against, and then we'll go up with some of the global players. But overall, we -- with our strong growth that we've actually posted the last couple of years, we think we've been outpacing the industry, which would mean that we either get more of our fair share and taking some share from that perspective. But when you look at kind of a broader question, is there's a whole another 50% of the pie that's made up of a bunch of small mom-and-pops, pieces that are moving around. I don't know. Gary?"

Just analytically, you're right, that's sort of the maddening -- one of the maddening things about the market is you can't just peg it to a specific number of is this what the market grew or shrank. To the best of our ability, if you go back to '19, we think the market probably grew low to mid-single digits and 3%, 4%, and we grew at 6%. And then if you take a look at last year, the best sources, we think that the market probably shrank 4%-ish, and we were down 1 point organically. So you take those 2 different data points and you say, okay, it's consecutively back-to-back years now, we think we've pretty squarely outperformed the market by that 1.5x goal that we've established. And certainly, with the strong start to Q1, don't have any signs of letting up at this point by any means."
