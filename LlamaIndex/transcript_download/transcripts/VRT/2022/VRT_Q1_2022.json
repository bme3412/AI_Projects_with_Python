                "text": "Well, 2022 was quite a year of transformation at Vertiv, a year focused on driving price, Americas improvement and progress on a high-performing culture. After a very disappointing 2021, we developed an ambitious plan to turn around the performance of the business over the next four quarters. Fourth quarter results demonstrated marked improvement consistent with the profit profile we shared last February. Our adjusted free cash flow performance, however, was not what it should have been largely because of working capital. We have consistently said the fourth quarter '22 performance will position us well for '23, and we believe that it has. We are increasing our view on 2023 adjusted operating profit guidance primarily due to foreign exchange, and that represents an over 75% increase year-over-year. And our adjusted free cash flow is anticipated to improve significantly because of higher income and less working capital usage. The demand environment continues to look good, and we're entering 2023 with significant backlog. Gio's focus on improved execution on everything is already apparent, and it certainly demonstrated in the improved performance in the Americas. I'm very excited about where the Company is headed with Gio's leadership. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Gio."

                "text": "Thank you, Dave. Thank you very much. I can certainly confirm that already in my initial days as CEO there has been a renewed focus on executional rigor and productivity, combined with the intensity that fosters a high-performance culture. And we are on Slide 3. 2022 was certainly a story of two halves, the first half painful when we did a lot of the hard work needed for acceleration and the second half strong with indeed a very strong fourth quarter, the strongest in our history. Fourth quarter organic sales were up 22% and driven by very robust growth in Americas and EMEA. Asia and China, in particular, was hindered by the impact of COVID, and we expect this impact to be short in nature. We ended the year again with a record backlog of $4.8 billion, which firmly supports our top line growth projections for 2023. Adjusted operating profit of $211 million was a little short of the guidance range. This is mainly due to the approximately $40 million less volume in China, closed by the COVID wave there. E&I performance was also weaker than expected due to some project cost overruns. These headwinds were partially offset by foreign exchange, although still negative, more favorable than assumed in our previous guidance provided in October. We are pleased by our pricing performance. We were on plan as we realized $135 million of price in the fourth quarter, and we delivered $365 million for the full year. We executed on the commitment we made early last year. There may have been some skeptics who discounted our ability to get price. That is understandable. I firmly believe that to deliver on commitments is the best way to respond to skepticism. And this is true in general. We demonstrated good sequential improvement in cash in the fourth quarter, but adjusted free cash flow was below expectations. There are reasons for the shortfall such as delayed collections in China, again, due to COVID and higher inventory due to some continued supply chain constraints. Because adjusted free cash flow is crucial, we're instilling more rigor accountability and discipline in the whole process. David Fallon and I are keenly focused on this. Let's look at 2023 our guidance a significant step forward, a significantly improved performance. Our organic sales are expected to increase 15% year-over-year at the midpoint of guidance, mainly because of foreign exchange, we are raising our AOP guidance from the $730 million to $750 million we announced in October to $750 million to $800 million, now over 75% increase year-over-year. We're guiding to $300 million to $400 million in adjusted free cash flow, supported by our plan of increased profit and working capital optimization. We will provide additional details around these plans as we make our way through the slides. Of course, we execute the year a quarter at a time. It starts with good execution in the first quarter, and we have details on our first quarter guidance later in the slide presentation. Let's now turn to Slide 4, and let's spend a few minutes on the market. Only one change from the October view, we moved cloud hyperscale down from green to yellow in EMEA. This was driven by seeing some market signals that demand may be stabilizing, albeit at pretty high levels. Worth noting in general, cloud and hyperscale providers may swing a bit between building capacity in-house or outsourced to cloud providers. So after the two categories should be looked at together. Our Asian market views remain consistent with last quarter. We have operated in a quieter market environment in Asia for 2022. I've recently visited Asia and I have to say, I'm pretty encouraged by what I saw and heard on the ground. For example, India is really just at the beginning of what looks to be a meaningful investment cycle. Americas is also consistent with the last quarter market view. Even though cloud hyperscale may be coming off their height over the last couple of years, they are still growing and investing at a healthy pace and one that supports our trajectory of business. We have discussed periods of digestion before. Certain customers are digesting their capacity. But this is a normal part of the cycle, and they typically digest at different times, which smoothes the overall impact in the market. Additionally, spending is being directed to higher-density loads, such as artificial intelligence which demands more compute power and the need for additional infrastructure. We also believe that there is a normalization of orders that is happening as supply chains improved and lead times reduce. As this continues, customers are likely going to return to more normal order behavior. That is good for the industry overall but they make order comparatives look more negative than what is really happening in the market. We remain cautious on the enterprise. Now that what we're seeing a different dynamic unfolding since last quarter, but more so because we are mindful of the macro around us. We know this segment would typically be the first to reflect a possible recession in the U.S.A. or at least a period of economic slowdown. This happened in 2020 with economic slowdowns related to COVID-19. So, we are staying vigilant. All in all, we remain cautiously optimistic on the market, driven by the continued need for data globally and favorable technology trends like artificial intelligence, requiring a higher density and more compute power. Now let's move to Slide 5. Customer demand still feels good. This is also confirmed by conversations with our customers around the world. Levels of investment and demand for our products and services continue to be healthy. We had signals -- we have signaled that fourth quarter year-on-year orders growth would be negative given a very strong comparison in the prior year, and that is what happened. As an example, 4Q '21, we experienced an order growth rate of more than 100% in Americas. We expect to see the same in 1Q 2023 with a tough comparison with the prior year when orders were up 34% and now an environment where customers return to a more normalized pattern of ordering. So, we expect Q1 orders to be down double digits. It is hard to provide precision on what double digits could look like as normalization of worded partners is still unfolding. We continue to have record high backlog and ended the year at $4.8 billion, which is a 49% increase from the end of 2021. This is inclusive of absorbing some order cancellations from a large hyperscale provider. This backlog represents over 70% coverage of the 2023 sales guidance, which is a much higher coverage ratio than we have seen in the past. This is reflective of an industry characterized by a very tight supply chain and still dealing with disruptions. We do think a normalization of the backlog at Vertiv and in the industry in general, is starting. And we expect this to continue as customers are seeing gradual improvement in supply chain and associated reduction in the time. We believe this process of normalization of the backlog will really be quite healthy for the overall market. We delivered on our pricing expectation, as previously mentioned. We continue to exercise the pricing muscle I referred to already on the 26th of October to price for the value we provide to our customers. Inflation, we still anticipated to be a headwind in 2023, but we expect to have a net favorable price versus overall inflation impact of approximately $100 million, thanks to the actions and executional rigor we are fostering. Supply chain continues to incrementally improve, but still not without its challenges, especially in the power electronics area. We are moving from a wack-a-mole environment to one where we are in better control also thanks to the increased supply chain resiliency, our alternative component and supply efforts are enabling. And in summary, while we see some mixed signals in the macro, the long-term demand continues to be healthy for our business. We have a bit of wind back relative to price cost, supply chain is trending a bit better. And we started the year in a very strong backlog position. Visibility is still not great in a dynamic global environment but we are focused on what we can control. I like where we are starting the year. Our fourth quarter performance sets up well for successful 2023 despite navigating what could be a more challenging macro environment. We are strengthening and I'd like to repeat this, the operating models and executional rigor in general and certainly around everything cash flow. So with that, over to David to walk us through the financials. David?"

                "text": "Perfect. Thanks, Gio. First, turning to Slide 6, this slide summarizes our fourth quarter financial results. Although fourth quarter results were lower than our expectations, looking at this slide holistically, you can appreciate the marked improvement from a year ago. As both Dave and Gio mentioned, there is still work to do, but fourth quarter adjusted operating profit of $211 million, was not only a record high, but a record high by about 40%. Going forward, it's our aim for every quarter to be a record quarter. And we are certainly better positioned today to deliver those types of results in large part due to what we have gone through over the last 18 months or so. With that said, let's look at the fourth quarter detail. Net sales increased 17% from last year's fourth quarter and were up 22% organically. This organic growth included 12% from volume and 10% from pricing while still comfortably within our guidance range for sales versus expectations. Sales were negatively impacted by approximately $40 million from the COVID wave in China, which significantly limited our production in the final two months of the year. Lower sales in China were partially offset by a $30 million foreign exchange tailwind versus beginning of quarter expectations as the Euro, RMB and British pound all strengthened against the U.S. dollar. Adjusted operating profit of $211 million was below our guidance range and this was primarily due to lower-than-anticipated volume in China, which should just be timing and weaker-than-expected results from E&I. Looking at the macro puts and takes, we realized a $135 million pricing benefit in the quarter, which was consistent with our beginning of quarter guidance. And pricing was partially offset by a $55 million headwind from material and freight inflation once again also consistent with our guidance. As a result, we were $80 million price cost positive in the fourth quarter and $60 million positive for the full year. $165 million higher sales volume contributed $50 million higher adjusted operating profit, and foreign exchange, although favorable versus expectation was still a $15 million headwind versus prior year. Fourth quarter E&I performance was below our expectations, and this was driven by cost overruns on several large projects and unfavorable mix. The project cost overruns were driven by execution challenges and a lack of visibility on costs, largely focused within a single manufacturing plant and both issues are very much fixable and are being addressed as we continue to integrate E&I in the Vertiv processes and systems. While certainly a challenging quarter and quite frankly, a challenging year for E&I, we are still extremely excited about this acquisition. There is likely more tactical work to be done than we originally anticipated. But as we mentioned previously, on the last call, the potential for sales synergies is much higher than we originally modeled as evidenced by the near 150% E&I backlog growth during 2022. To support this higher volume, we are actively investing in capacity expansions at existing Vertiv facilities in Mexico and Slovakia as we continue to push E&I products through legacy vert of sales channels. And finally, on this slide, we generated $143 million of adjusted free cash flow in the fourth quarter, and that was $135 million higher than last year's fourth quarter. Although a strong year-over-year comparison, adjusted free cash flow was significantly below our guidance range driven by several factors, including delayed collections in China from the impact of COVID, higher-than-expected inventory as we continue to manage supply chain constraints, while managing a record high volume and also delayed receipt of advanced payments for several large orders, which were pushed into and likely spread throughout 2023. Although fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow was short of expectations, we continue to make progress in stemming the tide. We burned $380 million of adjusted free cash flow in the first half of the year while we generated $150 million in the second half. We certainly were not alone in managing the challenges of inventory in 2022, but unsurprisingly, we saw a similar pattern with inventory, which grew $180 million in the first half, but just $30 million in the second half. There is still much work to do. But as Dave and Gio both mentioned, optimizing working capital will be a significant focus for 2023 for Gio, for myself and quite frankly, the entire company. We believe we strengthened the P&L in 2022. And now we will work diligently to strengthen the balance sheet. Next, turning to Slide 7. This slide summarizes our fourth quarter segment -- fourth quarter segment results with strong organic sales growth in each of the Americas and EMEA. APAC organic sales were relatively flat, primarily due to COVID. Otherwise, organic sales would have been up about 9%. Americas 40% organic growth, you need to say that again, organic growth was supported by 26% volume growth and 14% pricing. And each of these is an impressive number in and of its own. The volume growth was supported by launching additional thermal capacity in Monterrey, while also proactively addressing several supply chain issues, including the qualification of new suppliers. From an adjusted operating margin perspective, all regions were up significantly from last year's fourth quarter. And for the first time, all regions were price/cost positive. Americas improvement was the most pronounced as they were the first region last year to be hit by inflation against an underpriced backlog. They were approximately $60 million price/cost positive in the quarter which demonstrates the significance of the aggressive pricing program put in place at the start of the year. Both the Americas and EMEA adjusted operating margin were above 20% for the quarter, but APAC was not that far behind. Next, turning to Slide 8. We added this slide to highlight the turnaround specifically in the Americas region in 2022. Under Gio's leadership, we saw significant sequential quarterly improvement as that business focused on getting the fundamentals right, improving processes, while also holding people accountable by emphasizing a high-performance culture. It's still early innings and still work to do, but we are pleased yet not satisfied with the progress to date. Gio borrowed best practices from EMEA and institutionalize those in the Americas. And as this slide demonstrates, we are certainly seeing the results. Of course, and as a reminder, the Americas region, adjusted operating margin just a couple of years ago was in the mid-20s. So, there is still certainly room for significant upside in the Americas and, quite frankly, in all regions in 2023 and beyond. Next, turning to Slide 9. This slide summarizes our full year results. We developed an aggressive framework to transform the business at the beginning of the year, and we made significant progress. And we'll touch upon that in the next slide. But it really was a story of two halves with each financial metric. Sales were up organically 4% in the first half, but over 20% in the second half. Adjusted operating profit was up -- or was $95 million in the first half, but $345 million in the second half. Adjusted operating margin was 3.7% first half 11% second half. Adjusted free cash flow was a burn of $380 million in the first half, but a generation of $120 million in the second half. So although full year results are critically important, the underlying dynamics of the cadence of our improvements through the year are likely more pertinent to understand the Vertiv turnaround story which we capture on the next slide, Slide 10. In this slide, nicely captures the turnaround executed in 2022. While there were puts and takes along the way, we execute it relatively consistent with the profile we presented in February and delivered sequentially improving performance each quarter improving adjusted operating profit by almost $200 million from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. And of course, our fourth quarter performance is not an end in and of itself, but it serves as a strong foundation for continued improving results in 2023 and well beyond which serves as a good segue, so moving from the rearview mirror to the road ahead, let's turn to Slide 12, which summarizes our full year 2023 guidance. We anticipate 2023 sales increasing 15% at the midpoint with approximately 10% from volume and 5% from pricing, of which a significant portion is carryover or based upon enacted price increases. Markets currently remain healthy, and we have a record backlog of $4.8 billion coming into the year. Despite the recent strengthening of the euro, RMB and British pound against the U.S. dollar, we do anticipate a full year foreign exchange headwind of approximately $40 million, and that includes a $70 million headwind in the first half partially offset by a $30 million tailwind in the back half. We have raised our 2023 adjusted operating profit guidance range to $750 million to $800 million and that's up from the $730 million to $750 million range previously. And this change is primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currency from the end of October when we provided that previous guidance. The midpoint of our revised guidance range represents an over 75% increase year-over-year which is certainly significant. And we include a bridge on Slide 31 in the appendix that summarizes the drivers of this increase. And Gio will touch upon some of the dynamics in a couple of pages. But big picture is driven by higher sales, supported by our record backlog and additional pricing, much of which is carryover. These tailwinds are offset by an assumed $175 million of inflation. And this includes labor. About $75 million of labor inflation is included in that $175 million. And also a $40 million combined investment in R&D and additional capacity to support higher expected sales in 2023 and beyond. Adjusted EPS of $1.22 represents a 2x increase from 2022, and that's mainly driven by the improved adjusted operating profit. Adjusted free cash flow guidance of $300 million to $400 million is primarily driven by higher adjusted operating profit and optimized working capital, which, as we mentioned, will be a significant focus going forward. Gio will provide some of the additional color on working capital initiatives in a couple of slides. And please refer to Slides 31 and 33 in the appendix for additional detail on core assumptions supporting our '23 guidance. Next, Slide 13. This includes a summary of our first quarter financial guidance. And our first quarter certainly showed significant year-over-year improvement across all financial measures. Although we realize it's against a relatively easy comparison to a weak prior year first quarter. That said, our first quarter guidance continues the trajectory of improvement building off a strong fourth quarter. However, as a reminder, seasonality in our business generally results in our first quarter being the lowest quarter and our fourth quarter being the highest. So in general, like 2022, sequentially improving quarterly financial performance across each of these financial measures in 2023 is the expectation. First quarter net sales are expected to be up 21%, 25% organically given by higher volume and pricing benefits, partially offset by a foreign exchange headwind. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be $125 million at the midpoint with pricing, volume and productivity offset by inflation and growth investments. Adjusted EPS improvement is coming primarily from higher adjusted operating profit. Adjusted free cash flow is anticipated to be a use of cash of between $50 million and $100 million. Approximately $75 million better than last year's first quarter despite year-over-year headwinds of $20 million from cash interest due to higher interest rates and simply from the timing of payroll. Like many industrials, our first quarter typically drives the use of cash, and we anticipate generating adjusted free cash flow for each of the remaining quarters in 2023. With that said, I turn it back over to Gio."

                "text": "Well, thank you, David. Thank you very much, and we turn to Slide 14. We know that this guidance may look aggressive to some. It may as well conservative to others, but I want you to share some points that support our assumptions, our guidance. I'll start with adjusted operating profit. And let's look at the volume assumptions. We are at the highest backlog coverage point in our history over 30%. Additionally, there is always a lot more book and ship time and materials, services, spare parts, flow business, parts of the business that transact on a very short cycle and provide additional volume on the year. Our Q4 book-to-bill ratio was 115% and high levels that have characterized the entire 2022. Obviously, some moderation in our book-to-bill ratio is expected going into 2023 as customers return to more normalized, as I said, order pattern. This supply environment has been improving, and this should lead to a decrease in our need to do spot buys. We believe we have conservative estimates for inflation. We have a pricing plan that is largely already in backlog or based on actions that have already been taken and we have demonstrated our ability to get price. Let's look at cash flow now. You have heard all of us speak directly about adjusted free cash flow. We know we did not execute well in this metric in 2022. Certainly, the improved adjusted operating profit starts of off at a very different point for 2023. We have reasonable assumptions for elements that typically do not vary too much like interest back CapEx and we have strong working capital initiatives. This is a top priority for the organization, and we are managing this very closely. I would reference how we approach price last year. It was all hands on deck, rigor around the process accountability and focus on execution. And we executed well. The same rigor is around executing the working capital initiatives and the adjusted free cash flow generation. Let's now turn to Slide 15. Our focus areas for 2023 are clear, clear reflection of our priorities. We won the entire team pulling in the same direction. We are working on the culture fostering a high-performance culture where we do what we say, where ownership is clear where we hold ourselves accountable for delivering the results and we reward performance. Culture doesn't change overnight. It is a process. But as we strengthen our focus, we have seen signs that the high-performance culture starting to take hold and we see that through improved financial results. I've been visiting many parts of the organization lately, including China, India, Mexico, Slovakia, Ireland, the Middle East have met many people at all levels. And I'm very encouraged by what I see. People who love and care for what they do and care for the Company. We have a lot to do, but I feel the energy of the organization. Again, pricing, supply chain resiliency and trade working capital optimization are primary focus areas, and we will continue to build those muscles, continue to institutionalize this in the organization. This is what high-performing companies do. We still have great potential to operate in a more efficient and effective way across the Company. There is no magic wand. It's constant focus on the things that matter and strong operational execution, rigorous relentless pragmatic execution at all levels and starting from the top. I am encouraged by finish to 2022. The year was certainly not profit but are signs of real progress permeating throughout the organization and most importantly, showing up in our financial results. Dave started off the call today by indicating 2022 was a year of transformation assertive. I wholeheartedly agree, and it is just the beginning. With that said, we will now turn the call over to the operator, who will open the line for questions."

The magnitude of the combination of lengthening lead times and demand growth has driven a let's say, desire to cover longer and longer demand periods of our customers. That is absolutely unprecedented, all in general, not just Vertex customers in the industry in general. So being able to say how that will undo or normalize, it's very, very hard. But our expectation is that, it will probably take six months. But hey, this is a guess. We'll keep our eyes open and try to understand how it exactly unfolds. And I'll probably be able to tell better in\u2026"

We anticipated 80 at the beginning of this year, and we certainly would anticipate something north of 80 for full year 2023."

It's not going to necessarily be backlog, but it will be related to the availability of supply. And in particular, we have continuing challenges with power semiconductors and electronic components. So, there may be a bit of a hedge in the back half of the year because we don't have great visibility in that market, similar to everybody who is trying to get their hands on those power semiconductors. In addition, there is still a healthy amount of book and ship that is out there for the back half of the year, and we'll have better visibility into that at the end of the first quarter and probably much better at the end of the first half."

And I would say many components we purchase are much better than they were three months ago, six months ago. But there are certainly still challenges on very critical components that we have to procure across our entire product line, whether that's AC power or thermal. One, in particular, is the power semiconductors. And there's long lead times there, and we don't have great visibility. We do anticipate that improving as we go through the year. But our visibility there probably is a matter of quarters, not a matter of looking out what a year is going to potentially look like?"

One is us getting, of course, stronger, more robust. As we explained, we have strengthened our SIOP processes. We have made our supply network and supply base more resilient with multi-sourced components and also supplies. But at the same time, the market, albeit improving is certainly not normalizing that is at the same time on the supply side, especially as Dave was saying, everything that has to do with the part semiconductors. But the part semiconductors are present in this lot of things -- a lot of the components we use. They're not just as such, but components in the components we purchase. So we believe we are stronger. We believe we have figured a lot of things out during the course of 2022. But by all means, the message is not that everything is perfect out there. And it's still a complicated market, but we're much better equipped to navigate in that market."

So you can see how it kind of built up the most important, certainly, you got to start with adjusted EBITDA. And that certainly there'd be an expectation for that debt to flow through if that's higher or lower than what we're targeting. Putting working capital aside, the other three components, as Gio mentioned, there's some probability of variability there, but I wouldn't say significant. Certainly, if we're more profitable, we'll pay more taxes. That's just kind of how it works. But fairly certain that we would -- our CapEx number will come in within a range of what's reasonable with what we guided. And then, interests were definitely subject to movement in interest rates. But if we have significant upside or slight downside, it more than likely isn't going to be related to those three components. It's going to be the working capital component. And if you look at the $75 million use for full year 2023, we certainly assume success in some of the working capital initiatives that Gio mentioned. Working capital in and of itself will be a headwind due to the 15% organic growth, right? That's just how it works. But with that said, it's not hundreds of millions of dollars. It's not a $300 million or $400 million headwind, and we're expecting very significant or including in our guidance, very significant working capital initiative benefits. So that headwind could be $1 million or $200 million, you can do the math. And that's based on what we think sales are going to be in the fourth quarter of 23% versus the fourth quarter of 2022. So we have some provision in these numbers for success with optimizing working capital, but it could end up being a conservative assumption. There's still a lot of complications. The supply chain is not back to stable so there's a lot of challenges in front of us, but we're confident with this guidance we have provided. But if you look at the 350 versus, if you will, an adjusted net income for the full year, it's probably 75%, 80%. We would target in the long run, being in the 90%-plus range. It's always hard for an industrial company to get to 100% of free cash flow conversion if the expectation is to grow 10% to 15% a year. With that said, we believe this is a reasonable guide between the $300 million and $400 million, but is definitely room for upside if we're able to execute some of our working capital initiatives quicker than what's assumed in the guidance."

So AR, we had some complex larger orders that we had a process in 2022 with multiple deliverables, very tactical issues that we can address. So I feel fairly confident we can get to that 90% number in '24 and go forward.

I know there's always noise at year-end, but it looks to me like net debt only declined by about 1/3 of what the free cash flow was in the quarter. So there's like other uses somewhere, which I haven't figured out and that time today to try to sort that out. But if you do $350 million of free cash flow in 2023, can we expect something in the neighborhood of deleveraging net cash -- net debt improvement kind of in that range?"

                "text": "Yes. So, the significant use outside of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, Jeff, was related to the tax receivable agreement. There was a $75 million payment in the fourth quarter which takes that off our books completely. If you look at the leverage, if you look at the math at year-end, and you look at a trailing 12-month EBITDA number, I think our net debt leverage is about 5.6%, which certainly is much higher than we would like. But if you look at that same ratio looking at a forward-looking EBITDA number, meaning the approximately $865 of EBITDA anticipated for '23. It's about 3.5x levered. And then if you assume the $350 million of expected free cash flow is used to delever, whether sitting in cash on the balance sheet or to pay down debt. The net leverage gets down to 3x. So if we execute upon our plan in 2023 there's a relatively quick path to that deleveraging. And our long-term goal is to keep leverage between 2x and 3x that we're willing to go either below or above that range for specific reasons. But in general, if we execute what we have on paper here in '23, we should be closer to 3x levered as we exit '23"

We deliver to our customers. So that's something that will always be there and something that we did not have at least not with the efficacy that we have now in the past. So that stays I think that shouldn't read the phrase on the negative side. The message is despite an environment in which we see on the cost side in general, moderating inflation, but inflation nonetheless, we still see that in many parts of our business, we still can continue to work the price lever. And that's what we're doing. When it comes to 2023, in particular, a big chunk of our price is already in backlog. And that price in our backlog of course is very important for us to deliver on our guidance. But also the price that is not yet in the backlog is a price that we see being realized with the orders that we are in taking. But expect over time a normalization also in terms of price, and when that happens, and it is not necessarily now in the market because, again, the inflationary trends are still there. When that happens, we are better equipped with an ability to price for value."

I would tell us that there is red lumen behind the colors that you see here. But again, well, we keep our eyes wide open in case of something changes. When it comes to the EMEA, we see it more of a change of mix between cloud hyperscale and colocation, as I mentioned, in one of our -- in my comments earlier. And again, simply a change of mix between what the hyperscalers and cloud providers build for their own direct infrastructure vis-\u00e0-vis what they leave and the color may flip. I would not read dramatically into that. Just saying, hey, EMEA is going through the same type of order normalization that a signal and mentioned already, and we'll see how that plays out."

Our financial performance escalated in the third quarter, as we anticipated, helped by a record level of price that was realized as quarter. We are doing things differently, especially in the Americas, and we are seeing that translate to an improved financial performance. I know demand is becoming a bigger question for all companies given the macroeconomic environment. Demand win was strong for Vertiv, the data center end market as a true secular demand story, data is just going to continue to grow. We continue to execute work in the Americas is far from done, but there are very encouraging signs. Our operational focus is paying off, and we anticipate this will be visible in our Q4 results in the Americas. We have another significant step-up in operational performance planned for this quarter. Similar to our last earnings call, David will walk you through in detail why we believe this will happen, and it will sound very consistent with our previous discussion. We made an announcement earlier this month on our CEO succession plan. Giordano Alberta is the named COO in addition to his duties as America's President till we find a replacement, and will succeed Rob Johnson as the CEO on January 1 next year. I work closely with Gio and feel confident he brings the right leadership and experience to drive Vertiv's performance. I, again, thank Rob for all he has done as CEO over the past 6 years in building Vertiv's strong competitive position and foundation for sustained growth. As we are in the final quarter of this year, I know attention is focused squarely on the setup for 2023. We've provided adjusted operating profit guidance earlier than usual for 2023 that represents a 60% increase over our current guidance for 2022. People have asked about our visibility given the world is a complicated place right now. While visibility isn't perfect, the management team feels confident in their ability to execute and deliver Q4 and what it portends for 2023, which should be a very good year for Vertiv and for our shareholders. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob."

                "text": "Thank you, Dave. Starting with some key messages on Slide 3. We anticipated the volume ramp up in the back half of 2022 and we're certainly seeing it, with organic net sales up 20% in the third quarter, orders, excluding FX, were up 15%, which is even better than our preliminary orders number we provided earlier this month. We continue to see strong long-term market demand signals from our customers. Adjusted operating profit of $134 million was within the guidance range. Our improvement actions are taking hold, and we've seen the improvement building sequentially throughout the year. We delivered again on our price plan, realizing $110 million of price this quarter, and we raised our full year pricing expectations to $365 million. We saw price cost split $35 million year-over-year tailwind for this quarter. This tailwind will further strengthen into the fourth quarter and into 2023. Supply chain has improved over the last 90 days, even in some areas that have been hampering this, areas like circuit breakers, fans, and other certain electronic categories. Our work qualifying alternative suppliers is paying off, and these additional sources of supply support our fourth quarter volume projections. That being said, there are certain categories of power electronics that are still in short supply, and we expect them to remain so throughout at least mid-2023. Free cash flow is trending in the right direction, although we continue to carry high levels of inventory to support our increasing volume as fourth quarter is expected to be a record sales quarter for Vertiv. Orders have remained high, which is a great thing, but it has us carrying more inventory than expected. Fourth quarter free cash flow is expected to be an all-time record between $250 million and $300 million positive. And this should set us up, we think, for a great '23. We know our working capital is not optimized, and we are taking the full year projection down from our prior guidance, but we believe there is a significant additional cash benefit in 2023 and we have been working on plans and programs to make sure this happens. We are affirming the fourth quarter adjusted operating profit guidance of $230 million at the midpoint, which continues to support our view of a very strong fourth quarter and we believe a very good position and very well for 2023. Turning to Slide 4. This slide summarizes what we see in our markets by region. A few changes in Americas market view. Enterprise has moved to yellow, indicating a bit of caution, but is consistent with what we've been seeing in other global regions. The Enterprise market is exhibiting more caution given to the macro uncertainty, including the possibility of a recession, but still remains positive. The Communication market in Americas has been very strong for a number of quarters, and there's been a lot of investment associated with 5G technology cycle. While it's coming off those high marks, telecom carriers still invest, both in new technology and their existing network infrastructure. EMEA and Asia markets views remain relatively healthy as well. All in all, strong market backdrop continued for what we do. To note, we have been aggressive with our pricing actions for several quarters now, and we continue to see strong demand. We can get price and the ability has been demonstrated each quarter as we make our way through the year. Moving to Slide 5. We still feel good about customer demand with orders up 15% in the quarter, excluding FX, and that is compared to last year's third quarter, where orders were up 17% from the prior year. We have highlighted that we anticipate year-over-year orders declining in Q4. That is more a product of a challenging comparison to the prior year. If you recall, orders were up 51% in the same period last year. Fourth quarter orders, adjusted FX, are expected to be relatively flat in line with third quarter orders. We posted another record-breaking backlog at the end of September of $4.7 billion, which provides great support as we think about our 2023 top line. We continue to execute on our pricing plan and have delivered pricing consistent with our framework each quarter in 2022. Our pricing plan of $135 million for fourth quarter includes 80% already in the backlog and 20% to be realized on book and ship, but those actions have already taken place. We are clearly demonstrating we can get price in our markets. Supply chain has been improving, clearly not without disruption, but seeing things improve. Improving external market conditions, coupled with the extensive work the team has been doing to qualify new suppliers is helping our situation. The 1 area that is still tight in some of the semiconductor categories we specifically use. We use specialized high-end semiconductors different from some of the categories where you've seen in the market, a nice improvement on those. While availability is slightly improving for us in the specialized categories, we expect this tightness in the markets to continue through at least mid-'23. Some good news as it relates to our fan supplier. They are fully qualified and shipping production parts to us. There is favorability in the commodity and freight markets. We typically have 1 quarter lag before that reads through our P&L, but we anticipate seeing more favorability in fourth quarter and going on into 2023. Even with some good news at our back, we did raise the inflation estimate for the year by $15 million, with $5 million being realized in Q3, and $10 million anticipated in Q4. This is related to two primary factors: one, our regional sales mix is more heavily weighted to higher inflation zones. And we're also seeing some additional inflation in EMEA, mainly related to energy costs. In summary, our markets remain healthy. While recession proof is a strong term, there is an argument to be made, as Dave said, data will continue to grow through these economic cycles. That data has to be networked, has to be stored, and has to be processed in data centers where our equipment is. We are the market and technology leaders, and we are getting paid for what we do. Supply chain pressures, as I mentioned earlier, are easing, and we're seeing that benefit and expect that to continue to improve. Coupled with the work we have done to onboard new suppliers, we are proving operationally each quarter, and you're seeing it in our financial performance. Now I'll turn the call over to David to walk us through the financials. David?"

                "text": "Perfect. Thanks, Rob. Turning to Page 6. This slide summarizes our third quarter financial results. Our net sales increased 21% from last year's third quarter and were up 20% organically, including 11% from volume and 9% from pricing. The E&I acquisition contributed $115 million, partially offset by $25 million from the sale of the Industrial UPS business at the end of last year. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted net sales by approximately $85 million, with about 2/3 of that in EMEA due to the weakening of both the euro and the British pound. Adjusted operating profit of $134 million was within our guidance range, but at the lower end, primarily due to an incremental $10 million foreign exchange headwind compared to what we assumed this past August. This foreign exchange headwind includes both translation and transactional impacts within the regions where we buy and sell in currencies other than functional. Compared to prior year, we generated an additional $3 million of adjusted operating profit with the primary drivers summarized at the bottom of this page. Of note, as promised, we flipped the price/cost equation from negative to positive, generating a $35 million tailwind in the third quarter. We expect this tailwind to strengthen to about $80 million in the fourth quarter as we continue to deliver on our pricing commitments. Adjusted operating margin sequentially improved to 9.1% in the third quarter from 5.9% in the second quarter as we continue our margin expansion actions, expecting approximately 14% in the fourth quarter, which would be a record quarterly high. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.23 for the quarter, which was in line with August guidance, and $0.03 higher than last year, primarily due to the timing of income tax expense, partially offset by higher year-over-year interest expense, primarily due to debt pursuant to the E&I acquisition. Third quarter free cash flow was a use of $20 million. This use moderated sequentially in the third quarter from the second quarter. We anticipate free cash flow to be significantly positive, in fact, a record high in the fourth quarter. We spoke about an inventory reduction opportunity in 2023 on our last call, and we still believe this will happen. Supply chains are improving as our internal SIOP processes, both of which should contribute to lower inventory balances going forward. Next, turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our third quarter segment results. All regions saw strong double-digit organic sales growth. The Americas region grew organically approximately 25%, equally balanced between volume and price. Americas adjusted operating profit of $115 million and margin of 16.2% were positively impacted from improved price/cost, but offset by higher investment in fixed costs, including to support the launch of our new Monterrey facility. We are encouraged with the margin improvement in the Americas from 11% in the first quarter to an expected 20% in the fourth quarter, an in-year increase of 900 basis points. Still significant work to do, still significant opportunity, but the operational improvements Giordano and his team have introduced are certainly gaining traction. Organic sales in APAC increased 17% from last year's third quarter, 70% from volume, 30% from price. Operating margins increased 150 basis points, primarily due to favorable price cost and volume leverage. Finally, on this slide, EMEA sales were up 14% organically, 2/3 of that from price and 1/3 from volume. As a reminder, EMEA had the most challenging year-over-year comparison as organic sales were up almost 18% in last year's third quarter. Inflation has been more pervasive in EMEA recently, at least compared to the other regions, especially related to energy and our price realization in that region did not fully offset these inflationary headwinds in the third quarter. As a result, EMEA experienced a small price cost headwind in Q3. We continue to evaluate this inflation and our pricing response, but we do anticipate price cost to be positive in EMEA for the fourth quarter, and we do anticipate a fairly significant step-up in operating margin in the fourth quarter as well. Turning to Slide 8. We summarize our updated fourth quarter financial guidance, reaffirming adjusted operating profit of $220 million to $240 million provided earlier this month. All metrics on this slide would be record quarterly highs and by significant margins, including free cash flow, which is projected to be between $250 million and $300 million. Of course, we still have to execute, and there is much work to be done to capture significant opportunity going forward, but as we have consistently communicated since the beginning of the year, this strong fourth quarter should provide a solid foundation for a very good 2023. This slide provides a lot of detail compared to last year's fourth quarter, and it captures the progress we have made in 12 months, notably the $135 million of incremental pricing. Despite this year-over-year improvement, probably more important for investors to understand the doability of the strong fourth quarter, is the incremental bridge from this year's third quarter, which we will cover in a couple of slides. Turning to Page 9. This slide summarizes our revised full year financial guidance, reconfirming adjusted operating profit of $450 million to $470 million provided earlier this month. As Rob mentioned in his key messages earlier, we are reducing full year free cash flow guidance by $125 million at the midpoint with approximately $60 million of that from changed expectations for year-end inventory, $30 million from lower expected EBITDA and $30 million from lower expected cash collections. We had previously projected a more significant inventory reduction by year-end, but as we enter the fourth quarter with record projected sales volumes, and we anticipate continued strong volumes at the beginning of next year, we have reassessed those targets and will not press actions simply to hit a target. As mentioned, we have made good progress with SIOP, notably in the Americas. We have seen benefits from improved processes and we still anticipate an inventory reduction at some point in 2023. Another driver of reduced full year free cash flow estimate is related to the delay of cash collection enhancements, including driving more significant advanced payments for large orders. This delay is temporal as we expect to see benefits from these actions in 2023. Nevertheless, fourth quarter free cash flow is expected to be a record quarterly high. $175 million was the previous high, and free cash flow will be an absolute focus for us in 2023. Certainly understanding that margin improvement will not translate into value creation unless we convert that into cash. Next, moving to Page 10. This is a format of a slide we shared back in August to provide transparency with our plan to achieve fourth quarter projections. The main drivers are similar to last time, with the most significant difference being the addition of some very volatile foreign exchange. The macro story is relatively straightforward outside of FX, our fourth quarter lift from third quarter should be driven by volume and price. We discussed the drivers of the volume increase last quarter, including the launch of our Monterrey facility, improving supply chain dynamics and normal favorable fourth quarter seasonality. The volume lift is more pronounced in the Americas and EMEA in the fourth quarter, but APAC is expecting a nice increase as well. Pricing is expected to provide an additional $40 million of operating profit in the fourth quarter with 80% of fourth quarter pricing already in backlog. Now of course, we still have to execute to achieve these strong results, but we certainly have clear line of sight to this fourth quarter performance, which we hope this slide demonstrates. Next, turning to Slide 11. We have very often discussed internally and externally, holding ourselves accountable to the quarterly sales and earnings profile we presented back in February. This slide visually captures what we said in February and how our results line up with that profile. February guidance is depicted with the bars, the blue being adjusted for foreign exchange. Our results, both actual and what we expect for the fourth quarter are depicted with the black line. As you can see, both sales and profitability trajectory profiles are very much consistent with our February guidance with our expected fourth quarter adjusted operating profit, when adjusted for foreign exchange, very consistent with what we said at the beginning of the year. So with that said, I now turn it back over to Dave Cote. Dave?"

Gio is an industry veteran. He's an operator at heart and he's been with Vertiv for over 24 years, serving in a variety of operational capacities and really given the terrific background to run a company. He drove significant operational and financial improvements while leading EMEA, tripling the adjusted operating profit in that region to over 18% in a 3-year period ending in '21. And we're seeing the early stages of a turnaround story shaping the Americas, where margin has sequentially been increasing. The SIOP process has been greatly improved. And a focus on creating a high-performing culture is apparent within the organization. He knows a lot about the industry and has a track record of performance in both Europe and the Americas, which together represent about 70% of Vertiv sales. His broad operational background and that success uniquely positioned him to turn Vertiv into a high-performing business. He is the right person to lead this company and at the right time. So I ask Gio to talk a bit about his work on the Americas, the key initiatives underway, and to provide some early thoughts on 2023 that provide an introduction -- a better introduction to all of you of our incoming CEO. So, Gio?"

                "text": "Thank you, Dave. Thanks a lot. I appreciate the kind introduction. I want to assure everyone the transition is well underway, and we expect it to be quite similar actually. That is correct, I'm an operator at heart. It is my passion. I'd say it's my natural in many respects. And I think I can add considerable value. I'd like to share some things we've been working on in the Americas. Since March, we have done quite a lot, the full assessment, the transformation plan focused on getting price, ensuring leadership accountability, strengthening communication processes, operational excellence, systems and certainly fostering a strong sense of urgency. We have improved the SIOP process, have simplified the organization to focus on accountability and speed. We're driving the Americas regions towards a high-performance culture. Still in the early stages, but I'm encouraged by the sequential improvements we are experiencing. Let's turn to Slide 13. As I think about 2023, focus areas are clear and consistent with what we have been working on, margin improvement, price and cost, free cash flow generation, working capital improvements and profitable growth. We know the levers to achieve these objectives. We will have operational teams focused and accountable to meeting that. We will do so with a keen sense of urgency and rigor. Slide 14, please. And this slide shows some of our early thoughts on 2023. As you can see, visually, you should have more tailwinds than headwinds. Our backlog and order support healthy top line for 2023. End market demand is strong. We know how to get price. Additionally, we have some moderation of commodity and trade costs, and this year fixed cost will be held constant. Cash will be helped by overall improved profitability, built from unlocking significant working capital opportunities. These objectives are well within reach. There will also be some headwinds, certain categories of electronics as Rob say, remain tight, and there will be inflationary pressure as it relates to energy costs in EMEA as an example. That will not only impact us, but also impact our suppliers. FX remains volatile. There has been much discussion on potential recession. We don't expect it should have a big impact on our sales, but we are taking steps right now, for example, to restrict external hiring in anticipation. We believe that at the same time, sorry. But I like the view from here we can navigate these uncertainties, because we participate in a very -- in very good end markets. We are market and technology leaders. We have global scale. We have tremendous installed base, and we are very relevant with the key customers in our markets. We have a sharp focus on operational execution and excellence. We believe 2023 can be a very good year for Vertiv and Vertiv's shareholders. And as you may have picked up on this already in the last few minutes, I truly love this business and indeed, a love the company profoundly. I'm very excited by Vertiv's future. And you can tell I have a lot of passion, sometimes my passion mason takes over, and I tend to overelaborate on things. Hey, my Italian heritage means something indeed. So please bear with me. Work item and the upcoming Q&A, certainly an opportunity to prove myself. But before that, I want to wholeheartedly thank Rob for all he has done for Vertiv in the last 6 years. It was a lot of heavy lifting to do as we became a Vertiv, a stand-alone company 6 years ago. Rob took what almost a $4 billion start-up and transformed it into a growth company. We are the partner of choice of our customers, and we are very relevant across the entire market space. This happened thanks to Rob's leadership. We are grateful. So big thank you. Big thank you, Rob. With that, we will now turn the call over to the operator, who will open the line for questions. Thank you very much."

A lot of focus, as I said, on making sure that there is accountability and accountability happens also through very strong governance and a very consistent way of running the region operationally. One thing that we have done and we've been vocal about is, a return to office by which we make sure that everyone corporates and stays focused on delivering on our objectives. And it's a part of a cultural transformation towards making this truly a high-performance culture, not just the Americas, because entire that has started to deliver the dividends, I believe. But then we can elaborate on other elements that are the improvement of capacity, opening the Monterrey factory being probably the most visible example, but think about a broader capacity enhancement effort that has gone through across the entire business. The job we have done on reinforcing processes. And I always like to mention as Dave did talk about the SIOP, the sales inventory operations planning that is really the end-to-end glue that connects our ability to deliver to the ability of telling the customer -- sorry, the suppliers, what we will need in the future, all the more reasons crucial in times in which supply chain is complicated. I would add to the equation, the strong effort that we've been doing is going, still doing to multisource critical components, all elements that have contributed is an orchestration. There's no 1 kind of a 1 super bullet here."

On the Enterprise side, we just want to be a little bit more signal with some caution, but it's not for kind of an evidence of weakening of the signal.

But -- so when you look at the progression of price through 2022, we consistently said we had to burn through the backlog that was included in pricing or the pricing that was in backlog at the end of '21. So I think 80% of our sales in the first quarter of this year, was in backlog at the end of '21. In the fourth quarter, only 20% of our sales will be in backlog from 2021. And as a result, you can see the significant increase in ramp-up of pricing during the year. So I think we had $40 million in Q1 and we'll have $135 million of year-over-year pricing in Q4. I don't want to say we've reached a level of stability with pricing, but certainly, as it translates into profitability in the P&L, the fourth quarter will really be that first quarter where we can demonstrate what we can do as it relates to pricing at the level that arguably we probably should have been pricing at. So if you look at the wraparound impact for 2023 from pricing, and this just assumes that we keep the same pricing levels exiting Q4 into 2023, it's about $150 million to $200 million. We would expect to do better than that, because we continue with our pricing efforts. As it relates to inflation for next year, it's probably too soon. We certainly think there will be a year-over-year gross headwind from inflation. But from just about any perspective, we certainly would expect to be price cost positive next year, but probably too early to quantify what we think the impact will be for inflation."

We have work to do as we're saying on working capital and very, very central is our cultural evolution towards the high performance culture. Again, I've worked in many parts of the organization. So not only under a different brand, if you will, but also in multiple roles. So I believe I have an ability to lead the organization that is pretty advantages, let me say.

I think what we have said consistently over the last two or three quarters is that our issue is not a demand issue. The backlog is there. We have the orders. Probably the biggest risk is related to supply. And even though a lot of that supply has cleared up, notably with electronic components based on things we have done proactively, including qualifying new suppliers. And we talked a lot about the fan suppliers, but there still is a lot of volatility out there. And for a lot of these components, it's day to day, week to week. So we have better visibility than we had 60, 90 days ago. But I would still say there's risk as it relates to production and shipment.

We expect, at least on a GAAP basis, our inventory level at the end of this year will be around $765 million. So that's a $300 million increase in inventory, and that includes some foreign exchange benefit. So very clearly, inventory has increased each of the past 2 years. And very clearly at a level that is, as you say, in excess of what we need to run the business, we believe, on a go-forward basis. Now there are some contributory factors. Certainly, volume is significantly higher than it was when we exited 2020. And the supply chain has created many issues, not only for us, but many, many industrial companies out there. So it's hard at this point and probably premature to quantify what we think that benefit is, but it's something certainly we've been working on during the year. We could have probably taken that inventory level down a little bit lower at an exit point in 2022, but based on the significant volumes that we have to deliver this year and we anticipate heading into next year, we thought it prudent to not be overly aggressive. But with that said, because of the SIOP improvements, because some of the things we're doing with supply chain, we do believe there would be an inventory reduction at some point in 2023."

And we, too, are seeing some of the favorable benefits of freight rates. I would say 90% of what we do is on contract as opposed to spot. So we won't see the benefit immediately. But we also have adjustment clauses in those contracts, which should favorably benefit us over time. And we would say certainly at the beginning of 2023."

We did not include that in this quarter, and we knew somebody would ask about it. So we have the numbers ready. Yes. So Americas, we're targeting about 20%. That's about 400 basis point lift from Q3. EMEA, and this is based on the expectation of being price cost positive in Q4 and also the benefit of volume leverage, we anticipate adjusted operating profit in EMEA to be in the mid-20s. So call it, 24%, 25%. So down from what we had previously disclosed because of the additional inflation that we talked about, but still, a significant increase from what we saw in Q3 and a very significant increase from what we saw in Q4 of last year. And APAC, we would anticipate being relatively flat in Q4 versus Q3."

No one's recession-proof, but based on the size of our backlog heading into next year. And we certainly don't think the recession impact on use of data and building data centers is certainly going to be perfectly correlated for next year. So even in a recession, we feel pretty good about our top line. But if there are headwinds with the top line that roll through variable contribution margins, we'll take the necessary steps from a fixed cost basis to offset it. And our goal would be to maintain that $730 million to $750 million adjusted operating profit outlook regardless of any impact from the recession."

I believe the slides, it ended up as $0.02 contributor to EPS for this year. That's the latest assumption for full year EPS contribution from E&I. The question has something fundamentally changed around E&I compared to when you did the transaction? Or is this the same type of supply chain and some of these price cost issues that broader you guys are dealing with, and over time, we should still be thinking of the same sort of longer-term benefits from the E&I acquisition?"

                "text": "Yes. Thanks, Mark. I would say from a strategic perspective, we're more excited about E&I and the positive contributions to Vertiv today than we were at the time of the acquisition. And part of the value equation there was based on revenue synergies. And I would say our expectation for revenue synergies are probably 3x, if not more, what we had initially anticipated. Now unfortunately, that's not showing up in the numbers this year. So my depiction of E&I, probably rather crudely is a bad year, great acquisition. A lot of the issues that E&I is seeing from a profitability perspective this year are identical with what we have seen with Vertiv. So if you look at the operating profit margin profile quarter-over-quarter this year, I think it started at low teens in Q1, maybe 14%, and it should exit the year closer to 20%. And the story is similar. Inflation hit with a pretty good-sized backlog at the end of last year, and we were just a little bit slow in getting price. And if you look at the price we get in the fourth quarter, that's what really increases the margin from that low teens to 20%. So I would say we are more excited today than we were at the time of the acquisition, and sometimes we get asked with if you had to do it all over again, would you still do the deal. And the answer is a very profound robust, absolutely."

It has taken time to work our way through the backlog, but as we do, performance escalate. The profile will look exactly the same as we outlined in February, but in substance, the story and performance are in line with that profile. And market demand remains robust. Our order rates reflect this strength, and as market leaders in these spaces, we are furthering the gap by accelerating our new product introductions. We also continue addressing the operational areas, particularly, in the Americas that have caused shortfalls historically. While there are still some improvements to work through, the SIOP process in Americas is under the leadership of Giordano Albertazzi, is better aligned than ever. There's still work to do, but certainly it is in a much better place and continuing to improve. There are other process improvements also being addressed by the new management team in the Americas. They are getting after challenging areas that have really become apparent during these recent periods of high volatility. The new management team is doing exactly what we need them to do, cleaning these up and resetting the base for a great runway ahead in the fourth quarter and 2023 in a very profitable part of the business, the Americas. Third quarter is expected to be a sequential step up in performance followed by another expected large step up for Q4. I know some of you may question our ability to deliver the second half as presented in our guidance, especially a significant fourth quarter, but the team will walk you through why and how we believe that will happen as price realization improves and supply improves with newly qualified suppliers. We remain on pace to achieve a significant step up in financial performance that supports the earnings profile we presented back in February. End markets remain strong. Inflation is starting to moderate. We are navigating supply chain challenges and bringing additional suppliers online. And price is sticking. With the anticipated performance profile we expect that 2023 can be a very good year for Vertiv and our shareholders. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob."

                "text": "Thank you, Dave. Q2 was another step forward in delivering on our commitments for 2022. Starting with some of the key messages on Slide 3, demand continues at a pace I've not seen in the 30 years of my career in this market. Orders were up 17% in second quarter, 11% from volume and 10% from higher prices with a 4% deduct for foreign exchange. Our customers are focused on securing supply in a tight market and we see that both in our orders and backlog, which firms up the demand outlook well into 2023. Our adjusted operating profit exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. We continue to work through a number of key actions for improvement, but where we have fully implemented change, we are seeing the benefits take hold. Key among them is our pricing performance. We have proved to ourselves, and now, hopefully to you, our investors, that we are a business that can get price. Our pricing plan remains at $360 million for the full-year. Supply chain continues to be challenging, but we've made very good progress in securing qualified second and third sources of supply for key components. And we'll start seeing the benefit from that activity in Q3 and more fully in Q4. Our new thermal facility in Monterrey Mexico has started production and we have a new fan supplier coming online that is committed to help us meet the significant demand we're seeing across the thermal management market. Our work qualifying new suppliers is not only limited to fans. We have also qualified new breaker manufacturers, semiconductor suppliers and other suppliers. While there's still more work to do, we have been very aggressive in our actions to manage the challenging supply chain environment, most notably in the electronic components. In light of the supply change conditions and in conjunction with the expected significant sales increase in the second half of the year, we have not been able to reduce inventory as quickly or as significantly as we anticipated and communicated to you earlier in this year. While we're expected to use cash in the second quarter, it was larger than we anticipated. Although, there should be an improvement in the next six months we are reducing our full-year expectations for free cash flow to range up $25 million of use to $25 million of cash generation. As Dave mentioned, we made significant progress in our SIOP process globally, but we are especially happy with the progress that we've made in Americas and believe based on these improved processes, inventory reduction should be a significant source of cash flow in 2023. While there are many moving pieces, we provided updated guidance for our adjusted operating profit, reducing the mid-point by $25 million. We have provided a detailed bridge on the changes on these slides on Slide 12 that David Fallon will cover shortly. There is some rebalancing between third and fourth quarter, but in aggregate, we are still on pace to deliver a very strong second half with a noticeable step up across key financial metrics. Turning to Slide 4. This slide summarizes what we see in the market by region. No change in our view across our end markets versus what we saw in April, they are still quite healthy and very strong. Cloud and colocation remain robust. You have seen this in the cloud growth rates reported by all major cloud providers. AWS reported last week that their cloud business increased 33% in the second quarter and believes that we are still in the early stages of enterprise and public sector cloud adoption. Certainly, the growth in cloud market supports this view; data growth is not slowing down. Our view on the enterprise and small to medium business remain consistent from Q1 and we believe edge applications will continue to provide growth and lift for these markets. The communication market continues to see 5G investment and we're aligned with all the relevant players in this space. In the commercial and industrial market, vital applications continue to drive growth and opportunities for Vertiv. The market outlook remains very healthy. It is likely our year-over-year order growth rate will moderate in the second half as the comparisons to prior year will be difficult. But I want to reiterate the end markets we plan in continue to be very, very good shape. Moving on to Slide 5. Customer demand remains strong. Our order rate and backlog are a clear demonstration of this strength. We are delivering on our price plan and have implemented price actions needed to deliver the second half pricing plans, including that on our book and ship business. As I said earlier, supply chain continues to be challenging, especially in electronics. We do not expect this to abate in 2022. And we anticipate that we will see pressure at least through the first half of 2023. We have incurred higher costs for electronic components since we had to go to the spot market to secure some of that supply. In addition, material and freight inflation was higher as absolute dollars for the second quarter, but generally in line with the adjusted for the higher volume. We've started to see some relief in commodity and freight markets. We typically see a benefit on this on a quarter lag, but expected to provide a nice tailwind for us as we go into 2023. We've made good progress in qualifying additional suppliers on key components and should start seeing additional supply hit our factories in late Q3 and further into Q4. This provides support to our volume assumptions for the ramp in Q3 and Q4. We have to add some fixed costs sooner than anticipated to support the volume lift in areas such as our new thermal plant in Monterrey, Mexico. In summary, the market remains strong. Supply chain is still complex, but we are getting to the implementation phase for the new suppliers that should help alleviate sourcing pressures on the most critical components. With that, I'll now turn it over to David to walk us through the financials. David?"

                "text": "Thanks, Rob. Turning to Page 6. This slide summarizes our second quarter financial results. As you can see, net sales increased 11% from last year's second quarter and we're up 8% organically, including 2% from volume and 6% from price. The E&I acquisition added $114 million in net sales and was partially offset by a $60 million FX headwind, more than 70% of that headwind in EMEA. And we also had a headwind related to the divestiture of our industrial UPS business in EMEA and that was a $17 million headwind. Pricing added $80 million in the quarter, which was in line with guidance and double what we saw in the first quarter. As we continue to burn through the lower price backlog and recognize more sales booked after we implemented substantial price increases late last year and earlier this year. Adjusted operating profit of $82 million exceeded the mid-point of guidance but was $52 million lower than last year's second quarter. We list some of the components of this reduction at the bottom of the page, but in summary, there was $11 million or $10 million unfavorable price costs and $45 million headwind from FX and other, including a $10 million foreign exchange headwind, $10 million from direct labor, inflation and inefficiency in part driven by the supply chain challenges and approximately $20 million from cost headwinds in the Americas, primarily related to customer support costs, our sales incentive compensation program, and several other drivers. We expect to see continued year-over-year cost headwinds in the Americas in the third quarter, but we believe we have identified and addressed most of these issues as we will enter the fourth quarter and transition into 2023. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.10 for the quarter, which was in line with guidance. Second quarter free cash flow was negative $232 million, while we expected a net use of cash. It was certainly higher than we anticipated. As Rob mentioned, we have not reduced inventory consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the year in part due to continued supply chain challenges, but also in preparation for the significant volume ramp in the second half of the year. We are improving our SIOP processes globally. And as Dave mentioned, notably in the Americas, and we expect to receive an inventory free cash flow dividend at some point in 2023. Turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our second quarter segment results. We saw sequential quarterly improvement in organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted operating margin across all three regions. The Americas region grew organically 6.6% or $37 million with most of that growth coming from price. We do anticipate more balance between price and volume in the Americas in the second half of 2022, including mid-teen year-over-year volume growth as we continue to qualify new suppliers and launch the Monterrey facility. Americas adjusted operating profit of $82 million was negatively impacted year-over-year by price cost, higher fixed cost, including to support the volume ramp up in the second half and additional cost headwinds we referenced on the previous slide. In APAC, organic sales increased 5.9%, despite the China COVID lockdowns, which we estimate lowered second quarter sales by approximately $30 million. Notwithstanding the impact of the lockdowns, adjusted operating profit for APAC was actually higher than our expectations as we were able to drive higher sale in other APAC up regions while managing fixed costs. Finally, we continue to see strong growth in EMEA with organic sales up 13.3% with a good balance between volume and price. While inflation accelerated in the second quarter from the first quarter, so did our pricing. Our second quarter net price cost in EMEA while still a headwind was less of a headwind than what we saw in Q1 and we expect price cost to be a significant tailwind in the second half of the year. Moving to Slide 8. We summarize our updated third quarter guidance, which is about $50 million lower at the mid-point than our previous guidance. This slide summarizes third quarter versus last year, but likely more pertinent is an analysis of the changes from our previous guidance, which we provide in a couple slides. Despite the reduction, third quarter guidance still reflects a material sequential step up from the second quarter across all of our key financial metrics with organic sales expected to be up approximately a $100 million, 70% of that volume and adjusted operating profit expected to be up almost $60 million at the mid-point. Despite the reduction from our prior guidance, our third quarter expectations return us to an adjusted operating profit level from last year's third quarter, and will serve as a strong bridge to a substantial improvement in the fourth quarter and transition us into a very strong 2023. Next turning to Page 9. This slide summarizes our revised full-year financial guidance, which reflects the $37.5 million lower adjust operating profit at the mid-point versus our prior guidance. Once again, we provide detail of this reduction on Slide 10, the next page, but from a macro perspective, it is driven by a $25 million foreign exchange headwind and an additional $12.5 million net from additional cost wins in various categories, partially offset by the benefit from incremental sales volume. And more on this on the next slide. But as Rob mentioned, at the outset, as it relates to free cash flow, we are reducing our full-year guidance to a range of positive 25 to negative 25 in part due to lower expected adjusted operating profit, but probably more significantly from change expectations with our expected inventory reduction. We continue to improve our SIOP processes in, what is a very challenging supply chain environment, and we're encouraged that these improved processes will result in much improved inventory management, but the timing of the inventory reduction benefits will likely be pushed into 2023. Nonetheless, we are still anticipating significant improvements in free cash flow in the second half of the year and notably in the fourth quarter. Now, turning to Slide 10. We provide additional detail underlying changes from our previous guidance. As you can see on the slide, foreign currency translation certainly driven by the strengthening U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $160 million for the full-year and adjusted operating profit by approximately $25 million. We include some additional information on our foreign currency exposure on page 27 in the Appendix in this package. But just as a broad overview, over 50% of our sales are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the Euro and British Pound have been more acute than other currencies and a result over 70% of our negative FX impact is in EMEA. Moving on, incremental volume is expected to generate an additional $230 million of sales, so $100 million of that was in the second quarter. And these sales translate into $82 million of adjusted operating profit for the full-year. And there is a pronounced increase in volume in the fourth quarter, as we've increased sales expectations primarily in the Americas, based upon our success in qualifying new suppliers, and of course, the launch of the Monterrey facility. Material inflation is up $20 million from our previous guidance, $10 million in each Q2 and Q3, primarily driven by continued higher cost for electronic components and spot buys. We anticipate this pressure to ease somewhat heading into the fourth quarter, as we continue to bring additional suppliers into our supply chain. We have reduced profit expectations for E&I for the full-year by about $12 million. This is mostly driven by timing as shipments have shifted to the right and into 2023, but that business continues to improve and the demand environment continues to be strong with backlog at E&I up over 60% from year-end 2021, which pretend significant sales and profitability improvement heading into 2023. We have increased our fixed cost estimates for the year by approximately $30 million. Most of this driven by timing as we anticipated adding some of these fixed costs in early 2023, but we accelerated the timing to support the higher volume in the second half and for early 2023. Some of these higher fixed costs are also related to IT spending as we continue to optimize our ERP system in the Americas. And last on this chart, are other cost headwinds, primarily in the Americas, and as we mentioned, associated with any number of underlying factors, most of which we believe are transitory and addressable and should be mitigated as we enter the fourth quarter and pivot into 2023. So in summary, on this Slide, current full-year guidance is about $37 million lower than prior guidance at the mid-point, $25 million of that related to FX. With $50 million of $37 million reduction in the third quarter, offset by an $11 million increase in the fourth quarter, and of course, the $2 million beat in the second quarter. Next turning to Slide 11. We provide a sequential bridge from third quarter to fourth quarter for both net sales and adjusted operating profit, a $220 million increase in net sales, and a $113 million increase in adjusted operating profit. We understand that based upon our fourth quarter last year there may be some concerns with our ability to deliver a robust fourth quarter this year. To help allay these potential concerns, we provide this bridge which quantifies the sources of the uplift. First, the higher volume is certainly supported by improved visibility in the sourcing, and as we've mentioned, the launch of the Monterrey facility, in addition, it's very important to understand we normally have a seasonal volume ramp from third quarter to fourth quarter. The $35 million sequential pricing benefit is driven by the continued burn of lower-priced backlog in previous quarters with a vast majority of our fourth quarter shipments from higher-priced orders from late 2021 and early 2022. We anticipate approximately $10 million additional adjusted operating profit from E&I in the fourth quarter, primarily from incremental volume which should flow through at higher margins, pursuant to improved pricing, similar dynamic at base loadof business. And finally, as we've discussed on the prior slide, other is driven by the ramp down in the Americas cost headwinds, partially offset by additional fixed costs. So in summary the fourth quarter adjusted operating profit guidance of $253 million at the mid-point certainly represents a substantial quarter for us, especially considering the $13 million adjusted operating profit in the first quarter and the $82 million in the second quarter. However, we believe we are addressing two of the most pressing issues that drove lower first half performance, pricing and supply chain constraints and we have visibility and confidence in our ability to deliver these fourth quarter projections. On the following Slide, so Slides 12 through 14, we will continue to be transparent with our communications around our plan and provide additional details for the second half. In February, we laid out an aggressive achievable plan through the first six months. Our high-level scorecard reflects $91 million higher sales, $25 million higher adjusted operating profit, $10 million higher pricing, and $5 million lower inflation. And likely more important, our expectations for the fourth quarter have not significantly changed from the beginning of the year. On Page 12, this illustrates our current quarterly sales guidance at the top of the slide and our prior April guidance at the bottom. There are certainly a lot of numbers on this slide. I won't go through each and every one of them. But of note on the right is the increased volume growth from our previous guidance, higher across all three regions, but most certainly, most significant in the Americas as we have referenced. Turning to Page 13. This slide summarizes our updated quarterly adjusted operating profit and margin guidance, a similar construct to the previous slide with current guidance at the top and the April guidance at the bottom. We've already discussed changes in guidance and the step up from the third quarter to a fourth quarter that would be a record high and by a wide margin for sales, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted operating margin between 14% and 15%. Finally, for me, for prepared remarks on Slide 14, we show the expected quarterly 2022 progression of our regional adjusted operating margins. We have primarily focused externally on the recovery plan for the Americas, but as reflected on this slide, there is expected sequential quarterly adjusted operating margin improvement across all three regions. And even though not depicted on this slide the same is true for E&I. The scale of the improvement is more significant in the Americas and EMEA, as they were more impacted by inflation than APAC. But these charts illustrate that the entire Vertiv global team is driving improved execution. Clearly, we are focused on lock -- unlocking value on a global basis, and we know you are watching closely and we will continue to be very transparent with the status of our progress. With that said, I turn it back over to Rob."

                "text": "Thanks, David. Turning to Slide 15 where we provide our expectations for market conditions over the next 18 months or so. And we share many of the drivers of optimism for 2023 that pretends to be a very strong year. First, you've heard us comment on several times on the strength of the market we serve. All major cloud companies are growing strongly and continue to invest. Colocation utilization rates continue to be high. Edge demand and 5G rollouts will continue. And we are very well-positioned to win on both of those fronts. While we are certainly mindful of the possibilities of a recession, we don't think that blunts the growth of data, certainly not in the near-term or intermediate term. In fact, business could likely utilize more data in ways to enrich their business models and gain productivity across their operations in the face of recessionary conditions. In summary, our demand remains strong. We are currently filling our backlog for the second half of the -- for next year and we expect these favorable conditions to continue. On the right-hand side of this slide, we provide a quick list of reasons to be optimistic about 2023. Our fourth quarter is shaping up consistent with our beginning of the year expectations, with pricing actions not only returning profitability to where we were prior to the challenging supply chain and inflationary environment, but to a higher level. In fact, we believe we are in a much -- we are much stronger company today and will be much stronger company tomorrow. Because of these events over the last 12 months and the results we are very encouraged with that we see for 2023. Although, we are not prepared to provide a lot of detail into 2023 expectations, we still need to execute and deliver Q3 and Q4 and there's plenty of uncertainty with supply chain and inflation. To give everyone something to work with for next year, we directly expect that our adjusted operating profit to be 50% higher in 2023 than in 2022. Of course, there is still a lot of moving pieces and we will know more and we will update this expectation after our third and fourth quarters. So please view this as a preliminary guidepost as we look forward to a strong 2023. Finally, on Slide 16, and again, the summary of our key messages for today. Sitting here one quarter further into 2022, I feel more strongly than ever that the process improvements we've made and implementing throughout the year give us the ability and the consistency to get price, coupled with the corrective actions we've taken in the Americas are going to result in a very, very successful future for Vertiv. Without a doubt, the proof will be in the back half of 2022. I pledge to you that we are committed to executing well and transparently communicating our progress. With that said, I want to thank our employees, our Board members for your continued support in our organization as we continue to make significant strides forward. I will now turn the call over to the operator who will open up the lines for questions."

So just wanted to run through, you mentioned some of the cost headwinds in Q3 -- Q2, leaking through to Q3 and then improve into Q4. I thought maybe we could just like dive a little bit deeper on that. You mentioned some of the cost headwinds in Americas we have the Monterrey facility, et cetera. So maybe if you can just run through that quickly, that'd be awesome."

                "speaker": "David Fallon",
                "text": "Yes. Thanks. Thanks, Nigel. This is David. So there's really two categories. And we try to break those out on Slide 10. But first category is related to fixed costs and these are certainly tied, although not completely tied to additional costs to support the second half ramp up in volume. And some of these costs we anticipate to add at the beginning of 2023, but we've brought them forward. Most of these are plant-related costs, but also includes some engineering costs related to the qualifying of new vendors and parts. But I think there's probably a question if these would create a tail or a headwind for 2023. I think that $15 million we're expecting in Q4, you analyze that to $60 million versus the $30 million for this year would imply a $30 million headwind. Some of these costs certainly are one-time related to support either a hard ramp in a plant like Monterrey or a soft ramp in many of the other plants that are seeing high volume. So I would not anticipate to see a significant year-over-year headwind related to fixed cost in 2023. The other cost headwinds bucket, which we estimated about $18 million in Q2, $15 million in Q3. We truly believe these are transitory. These are very specific issues. We mentioned a couple of them in the slide deck. Customer support costs are also higher costs related to sales incentive plan. These are -- and there's a host of other issues that Gio and his team have been identifying and addressing over the last two quarters or so. And we believe we haven't identified. They'll continue to present a headwind in Q3, but we believe these should be fully resolved in the Q4 and from a year-over-year basis actually provide a nice year-over-year tailwind for 2023."

                "text": "Okay, great. And I just wanted to just curious on the material inflation. We've got a $10 million clip to both Q2, Q3, and then that's neutral in Q4. Is that just kind of a more normalized purchasing pattern combined with some of these new suppliers on ships? I mean, any color there?"

Inflation there certainly is higher than we anticipate it heading into the quarter. Yes. I think the light at the end of the tunnel is related to the new supplier qualifications that we're seeing that should come in online in the fourth quarter. So I think if you look at the ramp up of new inflation, I think we saw $15 million in Q1 that ramped to $40 million in Q2 and we anticipate that $40 million in new inflation won't remain consistent in Q3. And we actually have implied in our guidance a $5 million dip in Q4, but still subject to change. There's still a lot of uncertainty and challenges with the electronic components. We are still relying to a certain extent on spot buys, but we believe we've taken some really proactive steps and initiatives to address that higher -- those higher costs we're paying and primarily through qualifying new suppliers."

Just wondering the degree of confidence in executing on the second half free cash plan. And then, perhaps more importantly going into 2023, you mentioned inventory free dividends in 2023, does that suggests that you're confident -- you're converting of a 100% in 2023?"

                "text": "Probably not prepared to comment on a free cash flow conversion for next year, but we certainly are optimistic. Our beginning of the year guidance for inventory actually assumed a $50 million reduction from end of the year 2021. And that's a 2021 year-end number that was actually up fairly significantly from the end of 2020. In reality, we'll probably build inventory by about $100 million again in 2022. That's $150 million delta and there is other moving pieces, but that effectively explains the takedown in the full -- for the full-year number from $150 million to about zero at a mid-point. There is definitely opportunity as it relates to optimizing our inventory levels. We are very confident that we are executing towards that opportunity through our SIOP processes and I would be very optimistic that we should have a reduction -- a real reduction in inventory or certainly from a DIO perspective in 2023. So we refer to that internally as a dividend and it should not only create a very nice one-time benefit from that reduction in 2023, but certainly on a ongoing basis as we look at our reviews."

So we're -- this is the something we've been planning for a while and we think Monterrey's a great place to be from a cost perspective, but it is really to help the ramp and the demand that we see and the backlog that we have in the thermal business."

And Scott, I can assure you, that's not the first time that that question was asked, it's certainly been a focus here internally. We are still absolutely committed to holding fixed cost constant on a year-over-year basis going forward. The added fixed cost that we're seeing here in 2022, we -- that is more from a timing perspective; these are fixed costs that we had anticipated adding in the first half of 2023. Just to put these fixed costs in perspective and the need for the timing, our second quarter sale at a annual run rate were about 5.6 billion. That's ramping up to 6.8 billion in the fourth quarter. And so we continue to focus on fixed cost. I think we have seen increases over the last couple years, but most of those increases are pursuant to operations in higher capacity and also ER&D. I can tell you our administrative functions are absolutely constant from a fixed cost basis in 2023 versus -- or in 2022 versus 2021 and will continue to be, but we are selective with fixed cost and to the extent that it creates a future return including R&D, and from operational perspective, we'll choose from a timing perspective to sometimes accelerate those."

And we are in the middle of a -- middle of a ramp with that going into Q3 and then a steeper ramp going into Q4. As long as we get the supply we feel confident with the way that plant is operating and it is needed to provide the necessary volume increase more so in Q4 for us, but we feel confident with the team, they've spent a lot of time down there, and so far so good with the product coming out of the plant right now."

So we continue to focus on our customers, and in some cases, will actually fit the bill as it relates to hitting timing. Some of those customers support costs are also pursuant to late deliveries, and in some cases, our contracts include penalties if we don't deliver product in the agreed upon amount of time. So a lot of these things are certainly tied into the supply chain. We're still, kind of, day-to-day as it relates to the supply which creates a lot of uncertainty with delivery and some points we just have to catch-up, and spend some of our own money to hit some promise customer delivery dates. So the reason this is tied into the new supply is a lot of those pressure should go away as we continue to qualify new investors. And we need to spread that risk over three or four vendors as opposed to one or two. It really helps planning out of plant and a delivery schedule and we think a significant amount of these costs should go away."

And why pricing hasn't gone up at least a little with volume and inflation with the understanding that a lot of pricing was locked into backlog. At the beginning of the year, you obviously are seeing significantly more volume than you previously expected. You did raise your inflation forecast a little bit. So why can't you get a little bit more price as revenue and inflation goes up?"

That being said, pricing is now built into our D&A. How we go get it? That our process on a global basis, the approvals, when we raise price and we continue to look at that. Pricing was not just a one and done for us. We'll continue to evaluate where we have innovative solutions, making sure that we're getting the appropriate price we have for the market. So as we go through this year, into next year, we don't expect this to be something we responded to an inflationary thing, and we're done. We'll continue to refine the way we go about driving price. So I would expect as we part of our thesis has been create great products that that solve real customer problems that are innovative and get paid for that. So we'll continue to work that as we go through it. David can speak a little bit to why some of the inflationary stuff has the price as we drive it. We are getting to right now as we talked about into Q4, a lot of that old backlog falling away and a new price will begin to see in that. And it gives us a -- give us a nice uplift in Q4, but David?"

We made the decision because a lot of that additional volume is into Q4. We made the decision just to keep the pricing target at the 360, maybe so as to not overcomplicate things. But I -- it's absolutely fair to look at this as an opportunity for additional pricing based on that volume over and above the 360. But we also have not added in to this external model potential additional inflation that would also be associated with that higher volume. So on a net-net basis it's probably a -- an opportunity. But there would be an offset with additional pricing and additional and inflation just mathematically from that higher volume. But when we looked at it, we felt like we just wanted to kind of keep the messaging simple quarter-to-quarter. And we've included that as a net opportunity in our bucket of net risk and opportunities that we see for the second half of the year."

I think you said you expect supply chain and/or electronic component headwinds to last well into 2023. So what kind of price versus cost or supply chain assumptions are you baking into in that initial 2023 expectation?"

It's still very early. As Rob mentioned on the call, we thought we deliver on Q3, Q4. But I certainly would include on the list of potential opportunity for next year pricing. And you can look at that just from the increased sequential pricing that we're seeing here in on a quarterly basis in 2022. There's going to be probably $150 million to $200 million carryover pricing benefit just by doing the calculus, right? So as it relates to some of the other elements, notably backlog coverage, we're certainly -- we certainly have a robust backlog today to a certain extent we're filling backlogs for the second -- backlog for the second half of next year and with some of our products. So we're feeling really good from a demand perspective, but there's certainly we would place more uncertainty as it relates to inflation and the supply chain. As we have seen those are somewhat mercurial as it relates to month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, but we believe we're doing everything we can within our power and being proactive to address it. But it's hard at this point to give any type of quantitative detail on what we expect for next year."

And if you look at the backlog versus book and ship for Q4 it's likely higher than what we would see in other quarters. So -- and including for a fourth quarter, so a fairly significant ramp in Q4, at least from prior guide was not related to filling out a backlog. It was very directly related to have the capacity and the supply of components to ship that backlog. So every quarter, and even into every month, there's a certain amount of book and ship business. But I would say we have really good confidence in fourth quarter as it relates to the backlog coverage. And for us, it -- and as Rob mentioned, a bigger risk would be the execution of the ramp of the Monterrey facility and also the additional fan supply. So we don't think demand will be an issue certainly for Q3 or Q4."

And for a second question was on pricing and in particular pricing for 2023, maybe you can remind us how much of your negotiations are done toward the end of the calendar year, setting up for the following year. And kind of related to that to the extent input costs stay kind of where they are. Do you think you'll be able to hold onto all the pricing you've been able to achieve as you do go into 2023 or some of the customers going to say, oh, well, we'll input costs start going up. So I'm looking for a reduction next year. Thanks."

But as I mentioned earlier, we continue to look at additional opportunities for price, where we have innovative products and solutions. So I feel confident that we've executed on those, those have been put in place a while ago from that perspective. As it relates to customers asking or looking to take the price down, it's kind of a similar phenomenon. We didn't get a lot of pricing on the backlog that we had. It was part of our problem. We had to burn through that. So expecting kind of the same thing to happen, that the hard purchase orders that we have today that people wanted the price that we set forth in those as we go-forward. So I don't expect that to deteriorate either as we go into 2023, if inflationary conditions go. We've bought inventory at higher prices. They understand that. So it's something that wouldn't keep me up at night that that we're going to see that that activity. But we will continue, even in a deflation and pricing goes away environment, as I mentioned earlier. We'll continue with this pricing muscle that we have now to get price where it makes sense and we will be providing more value to the market. And that was a valuable lesson learned from us as we went through this whole activity, as that people do value the services and the products that Vertiv make."

With E&I, what we've seen, what I think David, kind of talked about and when he was speaking, is we're seeing some of the stuff pushed out of this year, pushed into next year, with some of the projects that they have. E&I have it experienced, kind of a little bit later than Vertiv did the inflationary impact and then lack of supply on breakers, and then were not just like us, slower to get price. We feel all that's corrected. We're really are excited. David mentioned the backlog for E&I is up over 60% I believe since we bought them. So the activity is good. Think we've got the price now being built in the back -- in the backlog and then the orders that are coming forth. So I'm really still very excited, probably more excited about the asset now than when I was when we acquired it. Yes, we had a dip and unfortunately it will go through this year with that, but we see E&I pulling out of this next year with the additional pricing. We have seen some projects shift, which happens in their business because they're heavily on the construction side of it, we have seen some of that shift and some of that will shift into next year.

Lot of people talk about breaker availability, the breakers drive a lot of the content in our products and we still see that as something that's not readily available. We have looked at additional breaker sources and have been qualifying them, but overall integration is gone well. And what I could tell you, as Gary mentioned on the back, on the actual funnel, the activity and the synergy with Vertiv, as we thought it would be is really there. So we never baked in any kind of sales synergy upside to remodel, but just what we thought would happen is, our sellers would pick this up, we would take it out to a wider audience to the enterprise and to a broader base of customers that we reach and touch. So happy with the -- very happy with the asset, happy with the management team there and what they've done. And I think this is going to smooth as it possibly could except for the getting prices quicker than we did and getting supply turned around. But overall, this fits in our portfolio very well."

As you know, this whole year has been one of having to transition through a backlog, be a hell of a lot more aggressive on price than we were and be a lot more aggressive [Technical Difficulty]. Okay. So this was at transition year for us. And the whole point was to get price, to get Americas fixed enough so that it was in a position where it could perform and to lead us into what I think is going to be a very good 2023. And that's going to be --that that's the game that we're playing here is that, work our way into a position where 2023 onward we're in the kind of position to perform that we thought we were before. This has been a tactical year that we've had to run into. The strategy of the company is still right, still good. It's a great position and a good industry. Technology is good. We're still doing all the new product intros still increasing R&D spending. The trick here is been to get Americans fixed and to get price running ahead of total inflation, not just inflation for 2022. And that's the way it looks like it's coming together at this point. As I said, I feel good about the profile and feeling good about 2023, but that's the game for us."

So what we are seeing is a phenomenon as people go back to the office to refreshed their edge, their closets, that type of thing. So that activity has been fairly strong. The projects in that space are fairly strong from what we're seeing from the field on the enterprise side of things. Some of our larger enterprise data center customers continue to build and continue to have demand on us. So we -- I'm pretty bullish on what we're seeing, just what's necessary to update the enterprises and then expand the enterprises as we mentioned, data is not slowing down by any stretch and people are using data to drive more efficiency in there. And in order to do that, they're going to have to have the compute and/or the infrastructure to make that happen. I know Gary, you want to say something."

So we look at more of the trajectory and the run rate of that, that all looks very healthy. In -- in the enterprise, there would not be a light CapEx number that gets published anywhere. So we do, we take a lot of that from voice to customer and from our pipeline and what we're hearing directly from the individuals into Rob\u2019s point. There we have not heard any conversations picked up anywhere around, hey, we're going to slowdown, hey, we're doing this, hey, we're planning for this in 2023, that looks any different than what we thought over the last couple of quarters. So we still think the enterprise edge IT channel, all that market is pretty healthy. The only one exception was China had a little bit of a setback in enterprise just because of the COVID lockdown that occurred in late Q1 and Q2. But they're coming out of that now. So we've seen that pipeline start to ramp up in enterprise. So everything we see in that area in channel, edge, enterprise are lumped all together, looks -- still looks pretty good in robust to us.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it. That's helpful. And then in the Americas region, that's really the key for you to have meaningful margin recovery. Can you just give a little bit more color on the internal initiatives that you have beyond sort of the Monterrey facility that would drive margin expansion go-forward?"

So certainly, if you look at the second quarter and some of the headwinds versus last year, so to kind of compare it prior to this higher inflation supply chain challenged environment. Price costs certainly played a role. The Americas was actually still negative price costs in Q2. I think it was about $10 million. We certainly feel like we'll address that with the additional pricing we expect to get in the second half of the year, but pricing will continue to be a lever. And we've never been super aggressive with pricing. And what we've realized is that we've left a lot of money on the table. We could have been pricing much more aggressively for a long while here and based on the strength of our products and notably our thermal products will continue to be aggressive with pricing. So that will continue to be a lever next year, even beyond offsetting inflation, whether from a dollar perspective or a percentage perspective. But a lot of the other things I don't want to discount them by calling them blocking and tackling, but there are a lot of elements of operations that we have identified over the last six months or so that can be significantly improved. We talked a lot about the SIOP process. That's not only going to improve our ability to manage inventory. It will improve our ability to drive margin. Capacity planning is another. The organizational structure continue to get benefits from ERP in driving process and putting additional tools in place. So going back to maybe the very beginning, this Americas region was built through a series of acquisitions that never were really integrated. We've done some of that over the last four or five years. And there's still a ton of benefit out there just by putting in place some improved processes. And I think we're already starting to see that benefit and we would expect an acceleration of those things in 2023 and beyond."

We\u2019ve been addressing key shortfalls, including execution of an aggressive pricing plan, taking a realistic look at inflationary pressures, creating a more action-focused America\u2019s culture, and changing management in areas of the business that did not execute well. As I mentioned on the last call, I\u2019ve been more personally involved in the business as we work our way through some of the near-term challenges. The actions we\u2019ve taken has started to take hold, and we see the benefits playing through. The pricing realized in the first quarter of $40 million exceeded our plan by $10 million. This gives us some confidence we are on track to deliver the pricing plan for the remainder of the year. We\u2019re comfortable with what we see in Q2 so far. Demand backdrop remains very favorable. We anticipate even more pricing playing through the P&L, as we continue to burn off more of that lower-priced backlog. The real test will be in Q3, when we expect to see the significant positive impact from our pricing actions that we\u2019ve already taken. And Q4 will more fully reflect our run rate adjusted operating profit that sets the stage for a strong 2023. While this has been very painful for everyone, I believe the actions that have been taken, especially related to price, position us well to perform in the second half and next year. We\u2019re taking this a quarter at a time, we cleared the Q1 hurdle, and we are on track for Q2, which will be a step up from Q1 performance. We still have to prove to you that we can do this, and we are squarely focused on taking appropriate actions to make sure we do that. So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rob."

Q1, as Dave said, was a first step, and we\u2019re driving incredibly hard to make sure we deliver on our commitments going forward. Starting with some key messages on Slide 3. I\u2019ve said this for a while. Demand remains very strong. In simple terms, data growth drives our business and everywhere you look in business and in everyday lives, everything incorporates data, and Vertiv plays an essential role in making sure those vital applications in society stay up and running. Our orders were up 34% in the quarter, even considering significant price increases that were put in place in late 2021 and early 2022. We are relevant with our customers. The order rates are a good scorecard for the market share and clearly demonstrate we are winning in the marketplace, in addition to reinforcing that more pricing is possible. As Dave noted, we exceeded our first quarter guidance. As anticipated, our adjusted operating profit was under pressure in the first quarter, but we are encouraged by the overdrive on pricing performance and inflation lower in the quarter than expected. That said, with lessons learned from last year, we are taking a prudent approach relative to inflation assumptions for this year. Even though we did better than anticipated in Q1 on pricing and inflation guidance assumptions, we are increasing the overall inflation for the rest of the year of $25 million. We are also taking additional pricing actions, but have not included that benefit in our guidance. Due to our large backlog that needs to shift, we expect to see more of this additional price show up in 2023. While it\u2019s hard to predict inflation and price this early in the year, we are taking a reasonable approach in light of what we are seeing. We have modified our second quarter guidance to reflect some pull ahead of sales in Q1. For Q2, we expect to continue to see some short-term delays from COVID-19 shutdowns in China. These are timing-related shifts that are not unexpected given the dynamic macro backdrop. Supply chain issues are still a challenge. Our pain points continue in these areas of electronic parts, fans and breakers. We are not sitting idle. We are working daily on countermeasures to help us address these challenges and expect that the challenges will continue through 2022. As mentioned earlier, 2022 is all about execution. We are on track with the plan we presented for this year. As mentioned, Q1 came in slightly better. We feel good about our trajectory of the quarters ahead, allowing us to deliver a strong second half and putting Vertiv in a very, very good position for 2023. Turning to Slide 4. This slide summarizes what we see in the market by region. There\u2019s no change in our cloud and hyperscale market. Strength continues in Americas and EMEA. The dynamic in APAC remains the same as we described previously. China cloud and hyperscale companies are working to utilize existing capacity to slow down energy consumption. We expect this to be a short-term phenomena, as data continues to grow in China and globally. The colocation market continues to be very strong in Americas and EMEA. This can also be a read-through to hyperscale strength that often use colocation as capacity for hyperscalers, both internationally and need for capacity in Americas. We do see colocation in parts of Asia slowing, driven by the same dynamic in China, as just described in the cloud market. Our view of the enterprise and small and medium market remain consistent from Q4, with particular strength in Americas. The communications market remains strong as technology upgrades continue, especially in 5G deployments that are driving our activity. In the commercial industrial market, things remain consistent with previous view as well, and we see good opportunities in this space, as a number of vital applications continue to proliferate. Moving to Slide 5. As mentioned, market demand remains very strong by our orders growth of 34%. The secular drivers of our end market remain firmly intact and seem to be intensified. The proliferation of data continues at an extremely rapid pace. This creates the need for additional capacity, and we are happy with our position as a pure-play in this market. I also would say, Vertiv has key differentiators that customers do value. We have always been a technology company, and our increased investment in R&D has provided innovative solutions. We see the product differentiator does matter to our customers, and we are now getting paid for that. Some examples of this is our new DSE thermal products that do not use water and are highly efficient. Another example of innovation has been our launch of our new GXT family of lithium-ion UPS systems. Along with the standard products that we deliver to market, we know that customers have specific needs, with engineering needs for modular to solve their problems. We work hand-in-hand with our customers, not only to provide standard products, but to provide custom products that fit their needs. I\u2019m very encouraged by our pricing realization of 4% in the quarter, which was largely based on backlog booked in 2021, including pass-through pricing of things such as batteries and trains [ph]. We saw positive price in all regions, including China. We realize we still have a big hill decline for the second half, but we have taken an aggressive pricing actions to deliver the plan this year. We are on track to deliver the pricing plan for the year. First quarter as an important indicator of our ability to get price. Supply chain, as I said earlier, continues to be a battle every day and has constrained our ability to ship product. The global commodity markets have been negatively impacted by the war in Ukraine. Relative to our guidance, we were favorable to the inflation plan for the first quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we are taking a prudent approach to the inflationary environment, and we\u2019re adding $25 million more inflation into the plan for the balance of the year. We have teams at Vertiv working diligently to qualify new suppliers and redesign products to alleviate some of the most critical pain points that we have. In summary, markets remain very healthy, and I feel good about our order rates that continues to be strong, even after implementing aggressive price increases globally. Supply chain is a challenge, but we\u2019re working through many of these different with various strategies to navigate the tough environment. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to David to walk through the financials. David?"

                "speaker": "David Fallon",
                "text": "Thanks, Rob. Turning to Page 6. This slide summarizes our first quarter financial results, which exceeded our guidance we provided at the end of February, as Rob mentioned. Net sales were up 5.3% from last year\u2019s first quarter and slightly up organically at 0.4%. There was an $88 million benefit from the E&I acquisition, a $15 million headwind from the divestiture of our heavy industrial UPS business, and a $20 million headwind from foreign exchange, primarily in EMEA. We are encouraged by the $40 million pricing benefit in the quarter, as both Dave and Rob mentioned, and that $40 million exceeded our forecast by approximately $10 million. Most of the backlog that shipped this past quarter was booked in 2021, prior to the additional price increases implemented late last year and early this year. So this is a good signal that our initial price increases are sticking, and we should continue to see our pricing translate into bottom line going forward. Adjusted operating profit for the quarter of $13 million was above guidance, primarily driven by $10 million of additional price and $15 million lower material and freight inflation versus what was assumed in the guidance. Versus prior year, the $99 million reduction in adjusted operating profit included the $40 million pricing benefit, as well as a $9 million benefit from E&I, which was more than offset by $85 million of material and freight inflation. We also had headwinds from foreign exchange, labor inflation and commissions, which actually came in below our expectations for the first quarter assumed in the guidance. Along with impacts from lower volume, a $10 million incremental investment in ER&D. We still expect price/cost to be neutral in Q2 and a significant tailwind in the second half of the year, as we will discuss in our guidance slides. Adjusted operating margin was 910 basis points lower than last year, and adjusted EPS declined $0.29, both reductions consist with the adjusted operating profit deterioration. Finally, on this page, first quarter free cash flow was significantly lower than last year\u2019s first quarter. The business is typically a user of cash in the first quarter, but we are negatively impacted by lower operating profit and higher inventory this year, with inventory up about $160 million from year end. Although we normally build inventory in the first quarter, we expected a $60 million to $70 million increase. We were negatively impacted this past quarter by both large project timing. And as we mentioned on our previous earnings call, an imperfect SIOP [ph] process in the Americas, which drove an inventory increase much higher than our internal expectations. We unnecessarily built inventory in the Americas based upon a higher sales plan, which drove the purchase of significantly more raw material than needed to satisfy first quarter shipments. We continue to address interlock issues within the Americas SIOP, and as a result, we believe that inventory in ship will balance out over the remainder of the year, consuming most, if not all, of the first quarter inventory build. The negative cash impact from higher inventory in the first quarter versus our internal expectations was offset by better-than-expected EBITDA and higher cash inflow from deferred revenue, resulting in first quarter free cash flow in line with internal estimates. And last on this page, liquidity at the end of the quarter remained strong at $720 million. Next, turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our first quarter segment results. The Americas region continues to see outsized impacts from supply chain and net price cost challenges. The supply chain challenges constrained the top line again in the first quarter, with $17 million of organic growth or 3.3%, driven entirely by price realization, and we anticipate price will continue to be a main contributor to organic growth throughout 2022. Americas adjusted operating profit of $58 million was again dragged down by price/cost, but we anticipate that relationship moving to neutral to favorable in the second quarter, and providing a nice tailwind in the back half of the year given our strong pricing response in the Americas. Moving to APAC. Organic sales were down 6.7%, primarily due to lower wind power sales and COVID lockdowns in certain parts of China. Adjusted operating profit of $42 million was down $11 million versus prior year, primarily due to deleverage on the lower volume, as well as unfavorable mix. Price/cost was neutral in APAC in the first quarter, as we continue to see lower levels of inflation reading through the APAC region. Moving to the right, EMEA continues to lead in regional growth, with organic sales up over 5%, with a good portion of that coming from price. The price cost headwind in EMEA accelerated in the first quarter, a trend that commenced in December and has been further negatively impacted by higher cost of certain commodities resulting from the Ukraine war. We have implemented aggressive pricing actions in EMEA as in all regions, and expect price cost to provide a nice tailwind in the second half of 2022. Next, turning to Page 8. This slide provides an updated look at our second quarter 2022 guidance, very much in line with our previous guidance. We believe the second quarter will be the next step-up in financial performance as we execute our plan to deliver a strong second half of 2022. It is our next hurdle to clear, and we feel good about the core assumptions in the second quarter plan, including inflation and pricing assumptions, which are unchanged from previous guidance. We anticipate net sales to be up 6% from last year\u2019s second quarter, with organic sales flat on lower volume offset by pricing. Our expected adjusted operating profit of $70 million to $90 million assumes neutral price cost in the second quarter. Turning to Page 9. This slide summarizes our full year guidance for 2022. Like Q2, our full year guidance is largely unchanged from what we previously provided, with some timing adjustments resulting from our first quarter beat. We are holding our full year assumptions rather than letting the upside from Q1 flow through. We have a challenging, but manageable hill climb in the second half of 2022 and are committed to making sure we deliver that plan. We reiterate the adjusted operating profit guide of $525 million at the midpoint, and we feel good about this plan and the key assumptions included. Delivering the second half will set us up for \u2013 set us up very nicely for a strong 2023, and we are laser focused on critical levers to make that happen. Next, on Slide 10, we provide an update of the quarterly sales guidance compared to our previous guide. This effectively updates the slides we illustrated in our fourth quarter call. Our February guidance is noted at the bottom of the slide and our updated guidance is at the top of the slide. We have reflected slightly higher sales for the full year, primarily in the second half, driven by higher expected volume and a smaller expected headwind from foreign exchange. We continue to expect a volume ramp as we progress through the year. This is the normal historic pattern, but we also expect some of the work we are doing on redesign and qualifying new suppliers to take hold, and we expect to see some incremental benefit from those actions, which will support the additional second half volume. Still, an overall conservative estimate on volume this year that we will continue to assess, but we are mindful that supply chain challenges are not expected to abate anytime soon. Turning to Page 11. This slide is an update of quarterly adjusted operating profit guidance. Again, the previous guidance from February is noted at the bottom of the slide, and the updated guidance provided today is at the top of the slide. We have provided ranges for adjusted operating profit for each quarter for the remainder of the year, with the midpoint for the full year remaining at $525 million. Price cost will be the biggest driver to sequentially improving quarterly performance, and we have confidence in our ability to realize the pricing plan based upon what we have realized year-to-date and what we see in the order book. Quarterly price cost assumptions are summarized as we turn to the next slide, Slide 12. Our first quarter guidance assumes negative price cost of $70 million, while we actually delivered negative $45 million, with price and inflation both favorable compared with our first quarter assumptions. We have maintained assumptions for neutral price cost in the second quarter, while we have increased expectations for inflation in the second half by $25 million, as there continues to be significant uncertainty with both material and freight inflation, notably in the Americas and EMEA. We are working diligently to avoid situations like last year, where we were chasing a growing inflation number for most of the year. We have also initiated additional pricing actions, given this higher expectation for inflation in the second half, but given the long backlog industry-wide, we are not relying on that materially impacting 2022. For the year, we anticipate price cost being a $90 million tailwind, including $135 million tailwind in the second half. This tailwind will set us up very well as we turn the corner into 2023, further enhanced by the year-over-year wraparound impact of our aggressive price actions. Finally, for me, it\u2019s very clear we are working hard to repair the credibility that was damaged with our Q4 performance. Q1 was the first step in doing that, and we will continue to provide detail on our assumptions and projections to allow for a transparent dialogue on how we are progressing. We know you\u2019re watching closely, and it is on us to make sure we execute well and deliver that 2022 plan. With that said, I turn it back over to Rob."

We did what we said we were going to do and are working hard, as David said, to earn back the credibility and really unleash the value of this business. The value drivers of this business are very much intact, and in many respects, being accelerated. We have worked hard to address the key shortcomings from Q4, as Dave mentioned, including taking aggressive price actions, enhancing our Americas culture, making changes in key management positions and implementing core business process improvements. The key actions to make the 2022 plan have been put in place, and we\u2019re encouraged by the progress to date. I have confidence we\u2019re on track to deliver in our full year commitments. As we deliver on these commitments, this will set us up very nicely for a nice 2023. We are determined to accomplish this, and I take this personally to make sure this happens.

Just first, could you address in, a little more detail, price on orders and if there\u2019s any way to kind of frame that relative to kind of how margin and backlog is developing? I guess kind of the underlying question is, there\u2019s a little bit of uneasiness here that the orders are \"too strong\" because there\u2019s not enough price in the orders. So maybe, we could start with that."

But I would say that if you take out two very large orders that we had, which we did get price on, our orders growth rate was about 12%. That being said, you are correct that we believe, and we\u2019ve mentioned that earlier, that there is still more price to be had. As we do this, and we said we are and continue to do that throughout the year, we\u2019re going to do it more specific to where product lines and areas are growing, where we have the ability to deliver and where we have differentiation. So, we do believe there\u2019s more price, but in the 34%, there was two very, very large orders that had year-over-year price that we were very happy with, which would have taken that orders rate down to 12%. But that being said, we believe there\u2019s more price there, and we\u2019ll go after it. David?"

And just to quantify some of that, heading into this year, in order to hit our 2022 plan for price and AOP, we had five mid-single digits pricing in the backlog heading into 2022. But we also realized we needed to get low double-digits as it relates to pricing on book and ship orders. So those are the orders that we\u2019ll progressively ship in Q2, Q3. And I think 85% of our shipments in Q4 will be based on book and ship, so orders that we book post 12/31 2021. And we are very much on track to realize that low double-digit pricing, low teen pricing in orders that we booked so far this year."

Other areas of surcharges, you mentioned, on freight. We\u2019re better at driving that and passing that along. And then I would say, the other area that we talk about that more shorter cycle is service and service renewal contracts.

Now, we did take overall volume up for the full year, and a lot of that is sitting in Q3. So the increase in Q3 is more than just the push from Q2. But in Q2, we also had benefit from lower foreign exchange than we anticipated. And we also took E&I sales up about $5 million. If you look at the overall adjusted operating profit takedown, that\u2019s about $10 million at the midpoint. So, we had previously guided at $90 million in our range, currently, is $70 million to $90 million, with $80 million at the midpoint. About half of that is related to that $15 million lower volume and the other half just relating to timing of some fixed costs."

I think you had that run rate of $160 million, you moved up to $110 million from $100 million. You mentioned the changes as a result of uncertainty in commodities, freight, but you\u2019re also being more prudent. Have you seen more issues crop up yet? Or is this just more of a preemptive call given the volatility of the global supply chain?"

            {
                "speaker": "Rob Johnson",
                "text": "Yes. I think that the key word in your question is uncertainty, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re hearing that on every call. We did beat the inflation number implied in our guidance for Q1, but we certainly are not celebrating. We overlaid $100 million at the beginning of the year in our guidance versus what the carryover impact was. So that\u2019s the math you\u2019re talking about. So we had $160 million of carryover and \u2013 $100 million of additional inflation. We used $10 million of that in the first quarter. It resulted in a beat, but we also understand the dynamics of inflation and especially where we are today, it generally accelerates. And what we have done for that overlay, we have increased the full year from $100 million to $110 million, and we also retimed the impact of that $110 million. So in our previous guide, we had assumed a flat $25 million per quarter. And we told everyone we would update that after the first quarter, after we understand the updated dynamics. But in our updated guide, that $110 million is now time, $10 million in the first quarter, $25 million in the second quarter, $35 million in the third quarter and $40 million in the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s definitely reflective of our anticipation of the possibility of inflation to continue to ramp up. And we generally talk about inflation in two buckets, material and freight, and to anticipate a question on the first quarter beat, most of that was in material. And the freight inflation we saw in the first quarter, notably in the Americas and also, to a certain extent, in EMEA, was higher than we expected. So, we certainly think there is risk and uncertainty across both material and freight, but certainly, the freight aspect of what we saw in the first quarter was higher than we anticipated."

                "text": "Yes, Scott, this is Rob. I\u2019ll start first of all, a couple of things we do to get price. Certainly, there\u2019s an approval process. I think we talked about this before that under certain multipliers in which people try to sell the product, they can go and adjust price for the customer. We\u2019ve tightened up those approval processes and taken those to a much higher level. For example, David and I are seeing much lower dollar on amounts that we are approving. So we taken the management team across the globe and really, have driven that pricing acceptance to be there. So we can control of that. And that\u2019s how we know we\u2019re going to get price from that perspective. And depending on where we are in the world and how the sales team and or the teams are getting compensated, I\u2019ll give you an example. A large portion of our U.S. compensation through our partners and so forth is they get paid more if we get paid more. So it really is in their best interest to go negotiate more. But each part of the market is a little bit different. When we go to pricing, our service contracts, our spare parts, we look at each one of those and understand what we need to get, what we believe inflation could be and then price above that. And quite honestly, I think the market and our customers have understood, it\u2019s not necessarily a price thing now, its availability thing and it\u2019s the ability to get it. So that environment has helped us as well drive through it. But I\u2019m confident where we are today, with our pricing process, with our review process, which incorporates the entire management team on a weekly basis. We look at new orders coming in, we see it come. While we haven\u2019t we can\u2019t jump up and celebrate and say, we\u2019ve beaten it, and we\u2019ve got it all done, we feel very confident that we\u2019re going in the right direction."

Whether it\u2019s dictating what the price increase is, the multipliers, approving deviations and just not letting any of that come through. As sales forces in general are your worst enemy when it comes to trying to get a price increase. And it\u2019s that more centralized drive with dictates as to what it will be and making sure it\u2019s showing up in orders pricing is making all the difference for us."

As it relates to inflation, I think that\u2019s still uncertain, but there likely would be some carryover impact there. But net-net versus what we were expecting internally, just 60 days ago for 2023 is unchanged, right? The bottom line for Q3, Q4 remains relatively consistent, and that\u2019s going to set us up for a very strong 2023 regardless. And the bottom line is if inflation continues to go up, we\u2019ll continue to price for it. And we\u2019re very confident we can do that based on what we\u2019ve seen over the last 90 days or so."

Now, there are some puts and takes, and we talked about one in the prepared remarks with inventory. So inventory came in higher than what we anticipated, and we\u2019re working on the issues there. But we did get favorability as it relates to the profit performance or the cash impact from EBITDA. And also, we had favorability related to upfront cash in the door from customers, which shows up in the balance sheet as deferred revenue. So that $150 million number was consistent with internal expectations. Now, for the full year, we still are comfortable with the $150 million positive guide. If you look at that from a quarterly basis, we do anticipate a another cash burn in Q2. It should not be as high as what we saw in Q1, but we do anticipate significantly positive free cash flow for both Q3 and Q4."

As we look at Asia, we break China out, we just talked about kind of COVID and the absorption of the current data centers. I mean, China has put a big plant down on building new data centers until the current data centers get utilized. I think that\u2019s a quarter or two phenomenon, maybe, a little bit longer, it could go through the end of the year. As it relates to \u2013 which is part of our AsiaPac story to India, we see actually strong growth there in colo and hyperscale. So just kind of separate that out, that\u2019s an area of what we\u2019ll see, call it, extreme growth going forward, and we\u2019re in a good position there. Singapore has done is kind of similar to China where they\u2019ve kind of kind of locked down on the number of data centers build, get the utilization up, get the PUEs up. So there\u2019s some dynamics there. And again, that\u2019s short-lived, a couple two or three quarters, but that\u2019s kind of our perspective. I don\u2019t know, Gary, any other thoughts?"

So maybe, that the large power, large thermal business suffers in China a little bit, but we should see a really active service retrofit, things that we can do to an existing facility to help them up their PUE. That\u2019s where a lot of that offset is going to occur."

If you look at that from a regional perspective, the overall organic growth is probably going to be outpaced in APAC and positive and EMEA, Americas flat to down, right? And \u2013 but price will be positive in each of the three regions. What is driving that overall sales difference is related to the volume, with volume up in APAC and volume likely down in the other two. From a price cost perspective, in Q1, APAC was neutral and the Americas was about $35 million negative and EMEA was about $10 million negative. If you fast forward to Q2, overall, we\u2019re anticipating to the neutral price cost versus the second quarter of last year.

You sort of talked about the commitment to the numbers. And I just want to understand, is it just pure conservatism? Or how much margin of safety is there in this guidance versus, what you guys have given us to February? Because the tone I\u2019m picking up is that it does sound like it\u2019s pure conservatism. Yes, things have gotten better, but you had enough cushion in the original guidance that you just don\u2019t want to raise for the year.

We have reasons to be optimistic based on our Q1 performance with both pricing and what we saw with inflation. But as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re not celebrating the inflation performance, because we saw what happened last year when we consistently underestimated what we saw with the inflation. And that is our caution. And in any regard, it\u2019s hard to take the first quarter and make broad assumptions with what the full year is going to do. And that\u2019s in a so-called normal year. So we certainly don\u2019t want to get out over our skis based on what we did in Q1, and we still remain very optimistic about hitting the full year plan. But we have introduced caution, and I think you see that with our assumptions for inflation. We beat by 15, but we took the back half up by 25. And some are looking at that as a \u2013 and I\u2019ve heard the words cushion used, and we do not see that as a cushion. We see it as a provision for the possibility of higher expected inflation.

And we also were able to actually include additional pricing in backlog from orders. So at the end of Q1, we had about $155 million of pricing in backlog that we would realize over Q2 through Q4. And then we had $165 million that is the go-get and book and ship. So if you take the $360 million, that hasn\u2019t changed.

Now, at $270 million, I wanted to check on the composition of that and clarify one, is the $270 million reflecting spot? Because we\u2019ve seen some big moves up in things like steel and freight, so I did want to make sure that is reflected in this $270 million number. And then the second part of it, is there any conservatism now for cost increases, maybe you haven\u2019t seen? Or is there \u2013 there no more buffer and is just based on the spot moves? Thanks."

So we had about $10 million of favorability in Q1 \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, $15 million of favorability in Q1, but we took the back half of the year up by $25 million. Now, we do have some internal breakdowns of where we expect to see that from a regional perspective and a breakdown between material and freight, but we certainly are \u2013 understand the fungibility and the uncertainty as it relates to inflation. So we certainly have provision, and we do not use terms like cushion or buffer as it relates to our approach to this inflation. We are assuming that this is going to happen, and that\u2019s very critical and key for us as we continue to price for it. So we\u2019re all hopeful, and I think every company out there is hopeful that inflation does not accelerate from where we are today. But we are not making that assumption. We are going to continue to assume that it gets worse. And if you look at that ramp of that $110 million, as we mentioned, we used $10 million in Q1. We\u2019ve provided for $25 million in Q2, $35 million in Q3 and $40 million in Q4. So we will be happy if things do not end up like that, but we are absolutely assuming that it will."

So even if steel to be sustained at the kind of spot prices it\u2019s been at recently and the cost of shipping things around the world stays at these levels or perhaps, even gets a little bit worse, you guys still feel like your cost estimate for inflation this year is appropriate?"

But we are certainly expecting continued acceleration, but we believe what we have provided for in the $110 million should cover a realistic expectation of inflation for the rest of the year."

And I don\u2019t recall \u2013 maybe, I\u2019m wrong here, but I don\u2019t really recall large orders swinging the number that much. So my question is, are we seeing here some evidence of increased product scope with E&I coming through on some of the orders here? And then maybe, just talk about E&I, how that\u2019s been tracking? I mean, I understand it\u2019s sort of in line with your FY 2020 plan so far, but margins, I think, are still tracking well below where the M&A plan was. I\u2019m just wondering what the recovery plan looks like for E&I margins?"

As it relates to a couple of large orders, I think we\u2019ve mentioned before, we \u2013 and I talked a little bit about the innovation. Some of our new innovations have really taken traction and people who hadn\u2019t bought those solutions in the past or buying those. And then in some cases, securing more than a quarter\u2019s worth of actual supply. We\u2019re seeing 12 months supply being orders pace for that. So yes. So we kind of wanted to take those two orders out that were around some of the new products we\u2019ve had to say, okay, our actual growth rate is around 12%. But that being said, we still very feel confident that there\u2019s more price to go get. And normally, we don\u2019t talk about, who the orders come in from and what, but we are beginning to see larger orders in the past. And then from the adoption of some of our new technologies that people haven\u2019t used in the past and shift anyway from some of the traditional methodologies of, let\u2019s say, thermal management. As regards to E&I, Gary?"

                "text": "Yes, absolutely, Rob. Hey, Nigel. Yes, we are pretty happy with the traction on the E&I side. So some of that incremental revenue that comes in, some of it flows through the E&I, as a little bit closer to the Vertiv, but it\u2019s a lot of the solutions orientation that we\u2019re getting by able to couple switch gear and busway into the broader solutions. We\u2019re also being pretty effective, at this point, of ramping up the sales forces, particularly in that Tier 2 colo space in the enterprise space to sell additional bus lane switch gear. So all of that is in flight and on that side, probably tracking a little bit even faster than what we thought, being offset a little bit because it\u2019s just tough to combine some of the cost synergies, clearly as fast as we thought with the supply chain and inflation piece of it. But if you take all of that and net it out, we\u2019re pretty much right on plan. And if you look at no different than the core Vertiv Q4, if you look at the E&I Q4, they\u2019ll be in the low 20s percent AOP type of run rate, which bodes really well to give us back on plan to where we should be for 2023. So all things considered, pretty happy with how the integration is going, the culture, the sales force, the customer responsiveness. The pricing, E&I got a late start on and we were very open about that even on the last call, but if you look at what they\u2019ve done over the last couple of months, there\u2019s good momentum there. So overall, really pretty pleased with the way that\u2019s played out."

That was a big initiative, kind of towards the end of 2021. So just wondering if we\u2019ve made much traction there and whether that\u2019s having any discernible impact in terms of supply chain?"

Some of these redesigns are spins of new boards and the new code for different chips. Those take longer, right? Those don\u2019t necessarily happen within a quarter. We see good progress on that. Some focused areas for us is some diversification in some of the breakers that we use. And we\u2019ve been well through the qualifications of that, and that should help us as we go through this and continue to work really hard on the fan supply and looking at and qualifying and bringing on more suppliers there and different designs as well. So I feel good about that, and I feel like that \u2013 some of those after we get through released to manufacturing and the volumes can be hit by some of these new suppliers, yes, it could be a positive thing for at least towards the end of the year going into 2023. So I think what we\u2019ve done, a lot of that will benefit from the latter part of this year, really kind of into next year as we move forward."

It\u2019s probably no surprise, but I\u2019m hearing some anecdotes that some of your customers are none too pleased, and in some cases, have threatened to move business from Vertiv to other suppliers, the first chance they get. Now, I get it. No one likes to pay more and we all like to complain when we\u2019re forced to pay more. So who knows what eventually happens. But my question is, a, do you worry that your price increases may ultimately leave you in a less competitive position versus your peers? And b, what, if anything, does this feedback suggest about your ability to maintain price when the supply chain eventually eases?"

                "text": "Hi, Lance this is Rob. Thanks for the question. I appreciate you joining today. What I would say as it relates to the competitiveness and the pricing. What we found something that we\u2019ve learned really through all of this, which has been a good thing is, when we innovate, when we have a superior solution out there in the market, we can get price for that. And so as we think about our pricing, it isn\u2019t just across the board price increases. And what we found is some of our leading innovative products that typically compete against, I would say, more small regional mom-and-pops is that people are willing to pay for that. They want a global supplier. So we feel good about that price sticking for the value we\u2019re delivering. I would say, we probably underpriced on some of these innovative solutions with the value that they bring to our customers. And maybe, some frustration you\u2019re hearing out there because we\u2019re not seeing, we\u2019re seeing in areas and finding areas where actually our prices were lower than they should be or lower than competitors. The market is frustrated in general about delivery and delivery timelines, because the growth that we\u2019re seeing is unprecedented. So I would say, maybe, some of the noise, at least as I hear it is, hey, we want to get those products. We want to \u2013 it\u2019s not an issue of the price, it\u2019s an issue of delivery, and we need those products sooner rather than later. And so our thesis, now, has always been and will continue to be as an innovator and continue to provide more value to our customers. The market will pay for that. For example, some of the PUE stuff that we\u2019re doing in our thermal units in China. We\u2019re one of the few, if not only manufacturers now in China that can meet the government-mandated PUEs coming forward. So we will continue to differentiate on innovation and continue to drive price as it relates to that. There in areas that probably more commoditized, what we rely on there and it works is our service organization. People pay more for Vertiv products if they can get the Vertiv service behind that. So that\u2019s another, I would call, a key differentiator for us that we\u2019re seeing, that through these tough times, people want our service."
