Joining me today are Vertiv\u2019s Executive Chairman, David Cote; Chief Executive Officer, Rob Johnson; Chief Financial Officer, David Fallon; and Chief Strategy and Development Officer, Gary Niederpruem. Before we begin, I\u2019d point out that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events, including the future financial and operating performance of Vertiv. These forward-looking statements are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the cautionary language included in today\u2019s earnings release and you can learn more about these risks in our registration statement or proxy statement and other filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will also present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release and in the investor slide deck found on our website at investor.vertiv.com. With that, I will turn the call over to Executive Chairman, David Cote."

                "text": "Thanks, Lynne. As I reflect on the past year with Vertiv, I am even more encouraged that everything we discussed in the roadshow has been proved to be even more true today. Vertiv has a great position in a good industry and we can differentiate with technology. Sales growth and margin rate expansion opportunity abounds and we have a team that\u2019s making it happen. That opportunity shone brightly in 2020. We were able to hold sales flat and significantly increase orders in a terribly difficult year. We were able to increase our margin rate on flat sales, which is always difficult. And at the same time, we ramped up investment in R&D, other growth drivers and process initiatives like the Vertiv Operating System, Vertiv Product Development, functional transformation and customer view, the Vertiv User Experience. The same is true for 2021 as Vertiv guides to sales growth margin rate expansion and the reinvestment that drives both in 2022 and beyond. Cash and overall liquidity improved markedly and net leverage is down a lot more than anticipated, especially in a COVID year. My confidence has increased, not decreased over the past year. No matter where I look in Vertiv, we are making great progress. As Timbuk 3 said in their 1986 song, the future is so bright, we got to wear shades. I felt that way a year ago and I feel that way even more so today. With that, I will turn the call over to Rob."

                "text": "Thank you, Dave and I truly appreciate your partnership and the good advice you continue to provide to me and my executive leadership team. I also want to thank the Vertiv employees for their efforts in Q4 and throughout last year. They pulled together and demonstrated how our collective efforts can accomplish amazing feats during a very challenging time. They have adopted to a can-do attitude, used creativity, ingenuity and outside-the-box thinking in order to serve our customers during this pandemic. I commend my team, my Board and our many partners for delivering the results I will share with you today. Moving to Slide 3, overall, the demand side of our business was very promising as Q4 sales were up over 11% compared to Q4 of 2019, driven largely by significant growth in the European and Asia Pacific regions. Orders for the quarter were up 9% when compared to the fourth quarter of last year. And I am pleased to remind you that the orders for Q3 were already up 15% as compared to Q3 of the previous year. Our backlog remains at an all-time high and is up $450 million from the end of 2019. We will talk more specifically about the demand side of the business over the next few slides. From a profitability standpoint, our adjusted EBITDA was $187 million, which was up over 25% from last year\u2019s Q4. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 160 basis points, driven higher by sales, higher contribution margin and lower fixed costs on a percentage basis. Additionally, our free cash flow at the end of Q4 improved over the same time period last year by $86 million to $175 million because of higher earnings and lower transformation spending. Turning to the full year results of 2020, we delivered $39 million more in adjusted EBITDA as compared to 2019, with sales down approximately 1%. This equates to 110 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin versus the prior year. Our free cash flow improved $171 million over last year to $163 million, driven primarily by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower cash interest. Looking at 2021, we anticipate above-market top line growth, increase in profitability, an even stronger balance sheet, all while continuing to invest significantly in strategic areas like research and development and sales and marketing. Finally, I wanted to let you know that we have transitioned to the measure of profitability from adjusted EBITDA to adjusted operating profit. While there are a few moving parts associated with this transition, this is nothing more than continuing on our committed path to keeping our financials and communications as simple as possible. In order to aid the analysts with this transition, we\u2019ve included Exhibit 99.2 in our 8-K that reconciles all the pertinent information. David will speak to this further during his section as well. Turning to Slide 4, we have used this slide over the past few quarters to illustrate what we are seeing in our market environment regarding demand. It\u2019s been updated here to reflect how things look today. In the cloud and colocation market, we continue to see strong levels of activity in every region, as indicated by the six green buttons in the top two rows. Emerging digital applications, such as online education, telemedicine, video and gaming are benefiting our cloud and colocation customers, and that demand benefits us as well. In contrast, we see the enterprise and small to medium business continuing to be challenged by COVID, as indicated by the red and yellow buttons in row three. Its spending continues to be mixed. We commented last quarter that this segment was slightly more positive in October than it was in July, and it\u2019s slightly better today than it was in October. The change is subtle, but it is trending in the right direction. Switching to the telecom side of things, we see little change from last quarter. However, we are seeing an uptick of 5G deployment in U.S. and parts of Asia. Several of our larger U.S. carriers are continuing to roll out 5G and we expect the rollout to continue for several more quarters. Finally, our commercial and industrial business often tracks GDP, but sometimes the quarterly timing can be different. There was a positive movement in a few light commercial and industrial applications over the past few months. The most notable changes we are seeing are taking place in Europe. So certainly some puts and takes, but overall, a strong market picture given our mix of the data center business. The digital applications people use every day continue to become more and more important to daily living as the result of demand increasing for those digital applications so they can be processed, stored and transmitted. This is creating a significant opportunity for our customers and, consequently, a significant opportunity for Vertiv. Moving to Slide 5, to reiterate, the overall demand is strong as evidenced by our order rates and backlog. Each of our world regions saw orders growth between 2019 and 2020, which was led by strength of the cloud and colocation markets. As I mentioned in the prior chart, the enterprise and IT channel markets are still not back to pre-COVID levels, but they are moving in the right direction. The IT channel momentum is evidenced by our integrated rack solutions revenue having increased every quarter in 2020. While we continue to maintain a high level of vigilance around COVID, our backlog is approximately $450 million higher than it was entering 2020, and we are confident about our position in the market for 2021 and beyond. Switching to the supply side, now I am pleased to report that most of our manufacturing facilities are operating normally. The measures we have taken and the priority we have placed on safety has allowed us to continue to operate in a relatively normal state amid the disruptions caused by COVID. Sometimes those disruptions are daily. Although we\u2019ve seen a strong appetite in the broader market for some of the components we use to manufacture our products, I\u2019m proud of how we have diversified our logistics and supply chains globally to mitigate any serious consequences. With that, I will turn it over to David Fallon to walk us through the financials. David?"

                "text": "Thanks, Rob. Starting with Slide 6, this page summarizes our fourth quarter financial results versus last year. Net sales were up $134 million or 11.4%, 9.5% when adjusted for a $22 million foreign exchange translation tailwind. We continued our strong momentum with orders, which were up 9% in the fourth quarter after increasing 15% in the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased $38 million or 26%, primarily driven by the flow-through from higher sales and slightly offset by a foreign currency transaction loss, translating into 160 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin. Our sales and profitability performance converted into strong free cash flow of $175 million, $86 million higher than last year\u2019s fourth quarter. We will review some of the drivers of this improved free cash flow in a couple of slides. Turning to Slide 7, this slide summarizes our fourth quarter segment results. Net sales in the Americas were up $3 million or 0.6%, as growth in telecom was offset by lower services sales, which continue to be negatively impacted by COVID site access issues. Net sales in APAC increased $70 million or 19%, primarily due to continued strong growth in China across most end markets, including data centers, telecommunication and industrials. Geographic locations outside China in APAC were up slightly as we continue to deal with site access challenges in some of those jurisdictions. Net sales in EMEA were up $60 million or 25%, almost entirely in the critical infrastructure and solutions product segment, driven by several larger colocation projects. From a profitability perspective, adjusted EBITDA margin improved in both the Americas and EMEA, but notably in EMEA, where margin increased over 600 basis points from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. This improvement was driven by both higher contribution margin and sales leverage on relatively flat year-over-year fixed costs. Higher contribution margin was primarily due to continued operational and procurement improvement despite a slight negative mix impact from larger projects. EMEA adjusted EBITDA margin has improved sequentially each quarter in 2020, reflecting the benefits of past transformational spending, the launch of the Vertiv Operating System and of course, the leverage benefits of growing the top line while holding fixed cost constant. Next, turning to Slide 8, this chart bridges fourth quarter free cash flow from last year, the $86 million increase is primarily a result of higher adjusted EBITDA, lower cash interest payments and lower transformational spending. The $175 million of free cash flow in the quarter was higher than our internal expectations, primarily driven by the timing of cash collections at the end of December versus early January. After beginning 2020 with the use of cash in the first quarter of approximately $200 million, we generated $366 million of free cash flow over the last three quarters, indicative of the strong cash generation potential of this business. This free cash flow has allowed us to pay down our ABL completely. And in conjunction with the $157 million of cash we received pursuant to the redemption of the public warrants prior to year-end, we increased our liquidity to $964 million at 12/31. And assisted by additional cash received in January from the warrant redemption of approximately $100 million, liquidity currently stands close to $1.1 billion, up from $446 million at the end of the first quarter. Next, turning to Page 9, this slide summarizes our full year financial results. Net sales were down $60 million or 1.4% from 2019 as higher sales in EMEA and APAC were more than offset by lower sales in the Americas, which was more significantly impacted by COVID site access challenges than the other two regions. When looking at our full year sales result it is instructed to bifurcate the year-over-year comparison. Sales were down 13% in the first half of 2020, but up 10% in the second half, in part driven by more challenging comps in the first half of 2019, but also demonstrating the rebound from COVID challenges and the continued resilient growth in our industry. Despite lower full year sales, adjusted EBITDA increased $39 million or 7%, and adjusted EBITDA margin improved 110 basis points as procurement and pricing initiatives drove contribution margin improvement, and fixed costs were down $40 million, aided in part by COVID cost-saving actions launched in the second quarter. Finally, on this page and this is the money chart. Free cash flow improved $171 million from 2019 as we benefited from lower cash interest payments, higher adjusted EBITDA and lower transformation spending. Beginning on Page 10, we pivot to looking forward, including with this slide, which discusses our transition to adjusted operating profit as our primary financial metric rather than adjusted EBITDA. For avoidance of doubt, we will not be reporting adjusted EBITDA going forward. We defined adjusted operating profit as operating profit, excluding the impact of intangible amortization expense. Operating profit is a GAAP financial measure that will be included on the face of our income statement, and we show an example on the next slide, with the only adjustment as operating profit, both prospectively and for historical periods, being intangible amortization, which we will also include on the face of our income statement. We believe using adjusted operating profit will greatly simplify our communication and analysis of financial results with analysts and investors. And by eliminating all adjustments other than intangible amortization, we address all components of GAAP financial results, enhance the quality of earnings and we also, of course, eliminate the previously disclosed historical adjustments. At the bottom of Slide 10, we provide a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to operating profit and then to adjusted operating profit. As you can see, net-net, the differences between adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating profit are the historical add-backs and also other onetime adjustments and depreciation expense. And adjusted operating profit is simply operating profit less the impact of intangible amortization. Last item of note on this slide, we will also be restating our historically reported adjusted earnings per share to remove historical adjustments, except intangible amortization, and we include those reconciliations on Pages 26 and 27 in the appendix. Next, moving to Slide 11, this slide illustrates changes in our GAAP income statement presentation going forward, which facilitates our transition to adjusted operating profit. Once again, we will specifically include operating profit, a GAAP measure, on the face of the income statement, and we will also include components of the previously used other deductions net, including amortization of intangibles. A reader will easily be able to calculate adjusted operating profit for any future or historical period with items included in the face of the income statement. And as Rob mentioned, to aid analysts and investors with this transition, which we hope is a once every 10 or 15-year transition, we have included Exhibit 99.2 to our earnings release 8-K, which includes restatements for historical periods, including quarters consistent with this presentation. It also includes revised regional segment information, including reconciliations from historical adjusted EBITDA to adjusted operating profit and quarterly and full year reconciliations from historically reported adjusted earnings per share to prospective calculation removing historical adjustments. And as always, Lynne Maxeiner, our VP of Investor Relations, and I will both be available for as any assistance and understanding in facilitating this transition. Next, turning to Slide 12, this page summarizes our current financial guidance for 2021. We expect the momentum from the second half of 2020 to continue into 2021, with organic net sales up 7% at the midpoint. We project adjusted operating profit of $575 million at the midpoint, up 68% from prior year and up 26% when pro forma-ed for 2020 discrete items as we illustrate on Slide 13. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 12% at the midpoint, up 420 basis points from 2020 and up 160 basis points on a pro forma basis. Of course, analysts, investors and we, internally, will have to recalibrate margin improvement goals on a relative basis using adjusted operating profit as opposed to adjusted EBITDA, with adjusted operating margin for 2021 about 180 basis points lower than the comparable adjusted EBITDA margin. But of course, the magnitude and substance of our long-term margin improvement goals are unchanged. We expect 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 at the midpoint, with disclosure of assumptions included on Slide 28 in the appendix. Finally, on this slide, we currently expect strong 2020 free cash flow of $285 million at the midpoint, up approximately $120 million from 2020. And we will provide additional detail on this improvement on Slide 14 coming up. Next, Slide 13. This slide illustrates our bridge from 2020 adjusted operating profit of $342 million to project that midpoint 2021 adjusted operating profit guidance of $575 million, growth of approximately 68%. To the far left in the bridge, we pro forma 2020 adjusted operating profit for 2 discrete items, $92 million for the 2020 restructuring reserve and asset impairments and $21 million for SPAC transaction costs in the first quarter of 2020. Compared to the resulting $456 million 2020 pro forma figure, we project the operating improvement in 2021 of about 26%. Components of this operational increase are illustrated in the bridge and include the following anticipated favorable drivers. Higher sales volume, continued contribution margin expansion from procurement pricing and loss initiatives and net benefit from restructuring of approximately $20 million, including $40 million lower cost from the 2020 restructuring program offset by $20 million of additional restructuring and related project expense in 2021. These tailwinds are offset by higher anticipated fixed costs, as we discussed in our third quarter earnings conference call, including additional investment of $65 million for R&D and growth initiatives and an anticipated $40 million impact from various one-time COVID cost saving actions in 2020 that don\u2019t repeat. We normally do not spend significant time explaining an other bar. But in this case, there are quite a few variances going each way included in the other bar on this bridge. Tailwinds include $26 million of the FX transaction loss from 2020 and $40 million of cost savings that we expect in 2021, not related specifically to the 2020 restructuring program. Headwinds offsetting headwinds include a $30 million negative foreign exchange impact on fixed costs, $25 million for global merit increases and $11 million of additional depreciation expense. Of particular note, the $51 million of historical add-backs from 2020, which included $13 million for stock compensation expense and $38 million for transformation-related adjustments, as detailed on Slide 19 in the appendix, is almost entirely offset by a combined $50 million of anticipated expense in 2021, equally split between stock compensation expense and continuing IT project implementation costs. Transitioning to Slide 14, we include a bridge for the $122 million projected increase in free cash flow from 2020 to 2021. We expect this increase will primarily be driven by higher adjusted operating profit and lower cash interest payments. These positive drivers will be partially offset by certain headwinds, including 2021 restructuring payments pursuant to the 2020 program, higher CapEx due to delayed 2020 projects and anticipated investment in operational restructuring. In addition, cash taxes are projected to increase due to expected higher profitability in several foreign jurisdictions. Overall, our expected 2021 free cash flow will be somewhat normalized, except for the higher cash requirements for restructuring. And CapEx is likely slightly elevated due to push from 2020 projects and incremental spend from the operational restructuring. And finally, for me, Slide 15, this slide summarizes our financial guidance for the first quarter, traditionally our lowest sales and profitability quarter and typically a quarter where we use cash. Before diving into numbers, as a reminder, relative to other quarters, last year\u2019s first quarter sales and adjusted operating profit were most significantly negatively impacted by COVID, notably in APAC. Even though it is challenging to specifically quantify the exact year-over-year COVID impact since COVID still presents headwinds in parts of our business today, clearly, last year\u2019s first quarter is the easiest comp of the 4 quarters. With that in mind, we expect 13% organic growth from the first quarter of last year. Our adjusted operating profit is projected to increase $55 million at the midpoint and adjusted operating margin is expected to increase 500 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share, is expected to be approximately $0.11 at the midpoint, up $0.76 from last year\u2019s first quarter. This year-over-year quarterly earnings per share increase, includes a $0.54 benefit from 2 discrete items in the first quarter, including the $174 million loss on extinguishment of debt and $21 million of SPAC transaction costs. In addition, interest expense in last year\u2019s \u2013 I am sorry, interest expense in this year\u2019s first quarter is expected to be $45 million lower than the first quarter of 2019, driving an additional $0.13 per share adjusted EPS benefit. A year-over-year benefit that does not repeat as significantly over the remaining three quarters due to the timing of the SPAC transaction and debt refinancing last year. With that said, I turn it back over to Rob."

                "text": "Thanks, David. Turning to Slide 16, I wanted to provide some color on the key themes and initiatives we shared with you on our earnings calls over the past year. First, our focus is on the top line. We continue to strengthen all of our customer relationships, but especially with providers in the cloud and colocation space. Doing so has led to order increases in 2020. Though large projects with cloud and colocation customers will always ebb and flow, we are gaining greater visibility into the future needs of our customers, which will translate into our ability to meet future demand and win projects down the road. Furthermore, we continue to hone our go-to-market efforts in the IT channel area. We saw the greatest traction occur in the United States and the impact got stronger as the year went on. Secondly, we are piloting the Vertiv Operating System, known as VOS, in 2 of our manufacturing facilities. Already, we are experiencing improved performance and favorable results as we formalize and standardize the way we work. The rollout globally, as we have said, will take time, but I am pleased with the early results that we\u2019re seeing. David talked about margin expansion in his comments and I am very pleased with our performance in this area. Our sourcing capabilities have continued to improve. Our pricing initiatives have continued to yield favorable results, and our restructuring actions announced last quarter are now in full flight. The foundation we have established and the trajectory that we are on gives me confidence in our ability to achieve the expansion plans we laid out a year ago. Finally and maybe my personal favorite, VPD, or Vertiv Product Development progress, we continue to focus and fund our research and development programs. Even though we couldn\u2019t \u2013 or had limited travel in 2020 imposed because of COVID, we still conducted the Vertiv User Experience, VUE, sessions to bring us closer to our customers and help us become more stronger strategic partners for the long term. We have seen the pace of new product and service introductions increase year-over-year. And in 2021, there will be no difference. In addition to these real-time results, we have also started to do some seed planning in a few future targeted areas to ensure we continue to be on the cutting-edge in our industry. Now, turning to Slide 17, I am very proud of the Vertiv team and what we have accomplished over the last 12 months. We delivered on our commitments. We demonstrated we are a great company in a growing industry. We have executed on many key activities, which have implemented many strategic \u2013 and implemented many strategic initiatives, which will serve us both well in the short-term and in the long-term. To all of our employees on the call today, thank you for the dedication and tireless effort to take care of our customers. To all of our investors, thank you for your support over the past year and being with us on today\u2019s call. I will now turn the call over to the operator, who will open up the line for questions. Thank you."

There is a fair amount of confusion here this morning, but from what I can tell, you bridged to something pretty close to where consensus was. So, thanks for all the restates. I wanted to talk about the normalization of cash flow a little bit if we could. And I understand there is some pressure here in 2021 as you layout in the bridge. We end up with free cash flow in 2021 that\u2019s on the low side relative to adjusted EPS or EBITDA or revenues. And I just wondered your view if you give any context on once we work our way through 2021 here, some of these items normalize, how you would kind of frame up the kind of the ongoing free cash flow picture?"

                "speaker": "David Fallon",
                "text": "Yes. Thanks, Jeff. This is David and thanks for the feedback. So I would point out two things in 2020 cash flow that are somewhat anomalistic. So the first and most significant is the cash required for restructuring. So we had anticipated to have approximately a $60 million cash outlay in 2021 for restructuring programs. Our current estimate is closer to $70 million, and $50 million of that is embedded in the restructuring cash payments bridge item on Slide 14. And then we have another a $10 million to $20 million included in adjusted operating profit for 2021 projects. So that\u2019s about 20 \u2013 or about a $70 million cash outflow. We will always have some outflow for restructuring from a cash basis, but that\u2019s probably high by a good $50 million. The other item I\u2019d point out is CapEx. I think historically, we\u2019ve kind of provided go-forward direction of CapEx in the $75 million range, we\u2019re guiding to $95 million next year. And a lot of good projects are included in that $95 million, but it also includes some projects that were pushed from 2020. So if I were doing a model, I probably wouldn\u2019t include $95 million going forward, but I would include more than $75 million. My guess is that we will settle in right around $85 million. All the other items, including cash interest, if anything, that should decline going forward. Cash taxes probably will increase. Working capital is one item that we still have a lot of work to do and we see some opportunity going forward, but other than restructuring and CapEx, I would say 2021 is somewhat normalized."

On the enterprise related activity and I guess the small signs of some additional life that you commented on. Can you provide any additional color on your visibility there? Can you see a pipeline developing in kind of bid and proposal activity, just wondering if you could put a little bit of kind of firmer point on that for us how you expect the year to play out?"

                "speaker": "Rob Johnson",
                "text": "Sure. Hi, this is Rob. Yes, what I would say is we always talk to the fact that we take a look at our pipeline growth, that\u2019s always the leading indicator. And even that is pre-activity on quoting, as you mentioned, which is exactly that. We have seen pipeline expand exiting out of 2020. So, that gives us comfort that the enterprise will begin to recover. Activity is intense in the design area with both electrical and mechanical contractors. So, again that gives me a reason to believe that we will see that recovery. It\u2019s just a matter of if and when \u2013 not if, but when people do kind of get out of this COVID thought and start spending again, but the activity looks good and gives me confidence. And then that\u2019s globally, it\u2019s not \u2013 and we have seen probably a quicker recovery on the enterprise in, let\u2019s say, Asia and the Europe is spotty and then Americas has probably been the lowest, but overall, the pipeline looks good and the activity is \u2013 we are very active there."

And I guess similarly is R&D kind of getting to the point where you are reaching your medium-term run-rate or do you think that there still needs to be a step up in R&D beyond 2021?"

Our plan at this point, especially as it relates to the Vertiv Operating System is related to continuous improvement, whether you can equate that to continues restructuring, I think that\u2019s probably semantical, but we will continue to invest dollars going forward to take dollars out of the business. So I wouldn\u2019t want to specifically commit to a dollar amount per year. I think we mentioned for 2021, we\u2019re investing an additional $20 million on top of the 2020 restructuring program. That\u2019s probably a good starting point. But if there are projects out there with returns, we potentially could invest more than that. If there aren\u2019t projects in any particular year, could be a little bit lower. But I think that $20 million probably is a good starting point. And as it relates to R&D, I will pass it on to Rob."

Innovation is our vector of differentiation and will allow us to get that margin expansion and there is a lot of call adjacencies and other areas that we can participate in. So, what we expect, while you have seen a fairly large ramp to catch up to that 6%, we expect 6% of revenue going forward to be in the R&D space so that we can be that innovative leader and look at other adjacencies as well. We expect that, that will produce long-term results over time. R&D does take a little while. Some of our products in the channel space will see benefits within the year. Some of the larger projects we see within 12 to 18 months. But we\u2019re very excited about the opportunities that we have more R&D projects, I would say, than we have funding. Our collaboration efforts have proven to be successful with the colo and hyperscale allowing us to design in and drive a better margin profile."

We\u2019ll continue to look at those. And if it makes sense, it hasn\u2019t been our first priority. Our first priority was to pay down debt and look at acquisitions as something as opportunistic as they come. And like Dave Cote has always said, they don\u2019t always present themselves when we want them to, but we continue to look and follow and track those companies that we might be interested in. But again, it isn\u2019t our first priority to go out and buy something.

And that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll be launching an ERP system in the Americas in 2021, and that takes continued capital. Operational, it\u2019s probably a little bit over third of the overall spending. Some of that is \u2013 continues to be maintenance spending, but also related to some of the restructuring that we announced last year. And that CapEx will be more skewed towards the back half of \u201821, and we\u2019ll see benefits from that in 2022. And the last bucket is related to the Vertiv Product Development, our R&D initiatives. And that\u2019s something \u2013 could be in the range of $20 million, $25 million that we would anticipate to continue going forward. So overall, as I mentioned to Jeff, the $95 million for this year probably is a little bit elevated.

So just curious on the switch from EBITDA to EBITA, effectively, does that map to a way you are changing internally in the way that you\u2019re measuring and compensating execs internally or is it just like a change in presentation for us folks? And I do think that some investors are struggling to compare like-for-like. So just on that regard, it looks like it was about $70 million of expenses that would have been added back in FY \u201820, stock-based comp, transformation costs and restructuring, those are three buckets that I can see. Can you just confirm that, even a ballpark, that would be helpful? Thanks."

So we had used adjusted EBITDA for internal basis for measuring and compensating. And we are definitely transitioning that to adjusted operating profit as well. On a go-forward basis, if you were to look at 2021, adjusted operating profit versus what we had included for adjusted EBITDA for \u201821, so the $660 million versus the $575 million, that difference is simply depreciation. So on a go-forward basis effectively what we are doing is holding ourselves accountable for capital spending and the resulting depreciation going forward. So of course, I think a lot of the confusion comes looking at the historical and some of the historical adjustments. But going forward, the only difference between adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating profit is going to be that depreciation. And of course, very critical is not having any adjustments going forward. So we\u2019re holding ourselves fully accountable for any expense that hits the P&L. And the only adjustment from GAAP is going to be that intangible amortization."

Certainly, if you look at a couple of the items that I mentioned related to Slide 13, we will have $25 million of stock compensation costs in 2021. That is a cost that, in 2020, was treated as a historical add-back. In addition, we have about $25 million of IT-related expense that historically we \u2013 and these are implementation costs related to new projects. That $25 million would have been included as an add-back for 2020. So that\u2019s $50 million right off the bat. The $20 million additional that you\u2019re referring to, I believe, is restructuring expense. And that is something, if you compare it to the $70 million historical add-back from the third quarter last year, also would have been treated as \u2013 or be subject to be treated as an add-back. So if that\u2019s how you are developing the $70 million, I would agree with that math."

So by investing in these new product categories or new product areas, it will accelerate our growth at 1.5x the market growth rate. And those things happen over a period of time, channel-type products, more IT-based products, 6 to 12 months we began to see a payback on those. And then the larger projects \u2013 products, typically 12 to 18 months and you begin to see the sales on those. And they could be things like a larger UPS \u2013 UPS is larger, megawatt UPSs or larger cooling or thermal management units. So those things take typically a little bit longer to get out globally, but it will yield over the next several years, our ability to outpace the market growth rate."

And then there is a mixture of that. I would say there is room for growth in both. If you just look at our overall market share, we have the ability to grow, and we think our collaboration method and model, working closely with our customers to design those products will give us the ability to take additional share. We had some very nice wins in conversion in 2020 of maybe some colocation companies we haven\u2019t worked with in the past. So we think there is plenty of room for growth. And as the expansion happens on a global basis, you\u2019ll see that the opportunities there. We don\u2019t necessarily sell our full entire product set in all of the hyperscalers today. So there is room for improvement there as well, whether it\u2019s a larger battery backup system or a larger STS or more power distribution, there is room for growth there, too. So we\u2019re certainly not at a saturation level and have the ability to continue to grow our share there. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re investing in R&D so heavily."

So my question is, where exactly are you seeing these gains? Is this mostly from taking business away from the smaller companies that we necessarily haven\u2019t heard of or are you also taking share from the Schneiders and the Eatons of the world?"

When we look at the \u2013 some of the share gain that we\u2019re seeing, certainly, there is a lot of regional players, smaller regional players that we compete against. And because of our global nature and filling out some product gaps that maybe we had, we\u2019re able to take that. But I think as it relates to Eaton and Schneider, we compete with them, and it\u2019s different in every region, right, how competitive they are or they aren\u2019t. But I would say, in general, we\u2019re \u2013 we believe we\u2019re growing in both cases and taking some share. I know just looking at some of the channel statistics in the IT channel side of things, well, a lot of people were down. I think our overall decline in 2020 was much less than our competitors in some cases, therefore, showing that we took some share there as well.

And I guess the question is, what should we think the potential there is for that kind of growth to be sustained beyond 2021? And I\u2019m not asking for guidance, but I\u2019d love to get your thoughts there. And if nothing else, perhaps we could talk about the $40 million of COVID savings that are sort of being restored in 2021. Well, clearly, that, I would think, that\u2019s not going to be recurring in \u201822 and beyond. On the other hand, it does sound like the growth in the R&D investments, are going to continue to increase for the next several years. But that being said, I mean, how should we be thinking about kind of that 26% growth? Is that their anomaly or just indicative of what the earnings potential is for this business?"

So one thing that I do want to reaffirm for everybody on the call and all investors and analysts is that we are still fully committed to the margin improvement goals that we have talked to historically. So just because we\u2019re switching to adjusted operating profit from adjusted EBITDA, it doesn\u2019t change the intermediate and long-term goals that we have for margin expansion. Now we will have to recalibrate. So I think we historically have talked about getting to 17% adjusted EBITDA. And I think an equivalent number for adjusted operating profit is somewhere between 15% and 16%, but we\u2019re committed to using 16% for that intermediate goal, and there is no reason we can\u2019t get to 20% in the long run. So I think we\u2019ve used that as kind of the long-term hurdle. That has not changed with this transition to adjusted operating profit. And so I think that very much works into your question about the future expectations for adjusted operating profit growth. Certainly, we see the growth in adjusted operating profit being enhanced and growing with the top line. So as long as we continue to grow that top line in \u2013 above market while expanding margins, there is no reason, mathematically, that we can\u2019t continue similar growth going forward."

The company reported very strong backlog growth of at least 32%, and that\u2019s now at a high level. As you\u2019re thinking about the backlog into 2021, do you think you\u2019re going to be able to sustain backlogs at this type of a high level or perhaps even grow it or would you think you\u2019re potentially going to work the backlog down a little bit this year?"

If you listen to both hyperscale and colocation, their business is going quite well, and that\u2019s a big driver in driving our backlog on projects. I think our global expansion, what we\u2019re seeing in China in the telecom side of things. Certainly, India now has come on the radar map to \u2013 for hyperscale and colocation. So I guess what I\u2019d say is we expect upper single-digit growth in the order rates and expect to continue to see that to happen."

And Rob, you mentioned a few times throughout the call about some strength that you\u2019re seeing in that market begin to materialize.

Or would you attribute it as well to some of the company-specific efforts that Vertiv has underway to better penetrate those channel customers?"

We\u2019ve got some unique products in our power distribution, IT power distribution side. We\u2019ve been pretty aggressive on our lithium-ion offerings and making sure that that\u2019s available. So some of the programs that we\u2019ve targeted are paying off. And we\u2019ve had, as we mentioned, quarter-to-quarter \u2013 year-over-year still was down. But quarter-to-quarter, we\u2019ve seen the improvements. So we feel like we\u2019re on the right trajectory with both new product intros, the programs that we\u2019re offering, we\u2019ve certainly simplified our partner portals, project registration being that, hopefully, easier button for our customers to come diverted for that. But we\u2019re taking that same, and we\u2019ve kind of globalized that same strategy to Europe, which is a little bit further behind and then driving it into the rest of Asia and China. So as you know, this is a big part of our strategy. This does take time. We\u2019ve chosen to do it organically. And \u2013 but we believe that our current strategy and trajectory will yield the results ultimately that we\u2019re looking for."

And I know in the past, you\u2019ve talked about regional data sovereignty driving growth. So how sustainable are these trends there? And what else is going on in the region that\u2019s leading to such good performance in EMEA specifically?"

                "text": "Absolutely, Andy. And great catch on the EMEA side of things. What we see typically with hyperscale and colo is typically rushing to various parts of the world. And so there will be, well, let\u2019s say, maybe not as much spending in the U.S. going on or growth. We have seen that in Europe. And I firmly believe the data sovereignty, people want data centers in their country, governments want that data there. They don\u2019t want it filling in data centers in the U.S. nor in China. So I think there is a lot of build-out. If you take \u2013 just look at the number of data centers, number of cell phone users, number of broadband access in Europe versus what you\u2019ve got in the U.S., I think we have a lot of runway ahead of ourselves as it relates to Europe and the builds that still have to happen there. The Brexit thing has driven lots of data center builds and parts that we didn\u2019t think were necessarily going to happen. So we continue to see strength, I think, over the next couple of years in the European side of things. We have taken some share there. We\u2019ve had some new customers that we haven\u2019t traditionally done business with in the past. So the customer acquisition has been good there. But I\u2019ll tell you, if you look at globally, I\u2019m pretty excited about, whether it\u2019s Europe or Middle East and Africa, South America, again, a lot of chatter and talk in India around colocation, hyperscale finally coming there. They are so underserved. So I think we\u2019ve got a lot of runway in other parts of the world, plus what\u2019s still happening here in the U.S. Not that the U.S. isn\u2019t going to grow, it\u2019s going to continue to grow. But I think we\u2019ll see outside, Europe\u2019s leading the way now. But I think you\u2019ll begin to see some of the Asia countries, and certainly, India begin to pop up on the radar screen as nice area. So all in all, I look at the next several years as we\u2019ve got a fairly healthy market in front of us."

And then, David, if you want to come in over the top, I would say, in general, we\u2019re probably weighted more towards the telecom side of things in parts of Asia-Pac. And that tends to be kind of lower than fleet average margin that we see as we continue to drive innovation and invest in innovation specifically in China, we expect to be able to get paid for that innovation as we go forward. So we\u2019re certainly focused on getting that closer to the fleet average. But there is a mix difference as it relates to the types of products we\u2019re selling there today. So channel is going to be an important part of our success there. And specifically, China, I think, is the driver from a margin perspective as it relates to areas of focus, being more local and driving that local innovation is going to be an important part of what we\u2019re doing in 2021 and beyond. David, any other thoughts?"

Joining me today are Vertiv's Executive Chairman, David Cote; Chief Executive Officer, Rob Johnson; Chief Financial Officer, David Fallon; and Chief Strategy and Development Officer, Gary Niederpruem. Before we begin, I'd point out that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events including the future financial and operating performance of Vertiv. These forward-looking statements are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the cautionary language included in today's earnings release and you can learn more about these risks in our registration statement, our proxy statement and other filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements made today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will also present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.

I am happy to say the team demonstrated excellent execution again in the third quarter. Vertiv continues to have a great position in a good industry. And I think the proof points of the last several quarters demonstrate that it's not a fluke. Even during this COVID time, the data center market remains strong and Vertiv continues to validate its leadership position in the market. While the team executed on both the top and bottom line over the past several months. They also continue to focus on seed planting. So we'll win not only in the short-term, but also the long-term. Initiatives such as the new Vertiv product development activities, VPD deploying the Vertiv user experience or customer view and developing their three-year Strategic Plan give some of the ways the Vertiv team is focused on ensuring sustainable success. I am really impressed with the adaptability and the receptiveness of Rob and his team. Overall, I'm just as excited today about the future Vertiv as they were a year ago, and I can't wait to continue working with the team. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob."

                "text": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Dave. Your ongoing coaching and mentoring has meant a lot to both me and the team. I also want to say thank you to the entire Vertiv team for their efforts in Q3. Despite the challenges of the quarter, one of the positive constants has been the team's relentless focus on delivering to our customers. The Vertiv\u2019s team creativity, energy and passion for serving our customers is always front and center. Now let's look at the slides. Turning to Slide 3, overall, the demand side of the business was very promising the sales were up 8.5% and orders were up over 15% as compared to Q3 last year. Additionally, this is the fourth quarter in a row where our backlog rose and hit yet another all time high. We will get a bit more into the specifics on the demand side of the business over the next few slides. From a profitability standpoint, our adjusted EBITDA was $179 million, which is up 31% from last year's Q3. This result in adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 270 basis points, this was driven by higher sales, higher contribution margin, lower fixed costs on a percentage basis. Our free cash flow at the end of Q3 was $129 million, which was $115 million higher than last year's Q3. During our last earnings call, we mentioned that we would be working on a restructuring plan in Q3. We completed that activity and took an $80 million restructuring charge for the programs. These restructuring efforts will drive $85 million of annualized run rate savings by 2023. David will share more details about our plans later in the presentation. Next on this slide, we wanted to provide you some of the ranges for the expected outcome of Q4. We are anticipating the implications of COVID. They continue to fluctuate based on our current visibility, we expect our organic sales to be up 6% to 8% and our adjusted EBITDA will be up 18% to 24% from the last quarter, Q4 last year. So while these dynamics can change, we did want to share with you, what we're currently seeing playing out in Q4. Now all this is clearly predicated on COVID not impacting our customers, and not impacting site access anymore than what we saw in Q3. We'll discuss more on this topic later. Finally, I wanted to add a bit of color around 2021. As we see things right now, the demand side is holding up and our backlog to be robust as we exit the year. On the cost side, we're keeping a close eye on fixed costs constant, but we're continually looking at investments in VPDs and other growth programs to ensure long-term success. Turning to Slide 4, we use this slide last quarter and received good feedback on it. So we wanted to keep it in for consistency, and also add our thoughts around the current market environment. The chart is simple but it realized the real-time view we have on the demand side of things. It is qualitative in nature and depicts our view on the level of health and activity in each of the markets we serve. We continue to see strong levels of activity in every region in the cloud and colocation markets, as indicated by the six green buttons in the top two rows. Emerging vital applications such as online education, telemedicine, video and gaming are benefiting our cloud and colocation customers, as surge in demand is benefiting us as well. In contrast, we see the enterprise and small-to-medium business still being challenged by COVID and indicated by the red and yellow buttons in row three. This segment spending continues to be mixed. It's probably slightly more positive today than it was 90 days ago, but not significant enough to upgrade any of the regions in this particular space. Switching to the telecom side of things, most of our regions are pretty consistent with prior quarter. We continue to see 5G deployments in U.S. and parts of Asia. Well, China is certainly deploying 5G. We see a small pause at the moment as they digest some of their equipment. This is not surprising, and we expect that it will be short lived. Finally, as we told you before, our C&I business often tracks GDP over the longer run, but sometimes the quarterly timing can be different. While this segment has held up better than expected, things remained relatively flat. Well, certainly some puts and takes but overall a decent market picture when you consider our mix of data center business. The applications people use every day to become more and more vital because those applications are needed to be processed, stored, transmitted and this creates a great backdrop for our business. Moving to Slide 5, to reiterate, the overall demand is strong as evidenced by our order rates in our record backlog led by EMEA and Asia. EMEA was particularly strong, due to some larger projects, specifically in the colocation market. As I mentioned in the prior chart, the enterprise and IT channel markets are still not back to pre-COVID levels. But there are signs of life, as evidenced by our integrated rack solutions business having positive growth in the third quarter this year versus the same quarter last year. Switching to the supply side now, I'm pleased to report that most of our facilities are operating normally. However, I will say that things continue to evolve very rapidly. We're being very cautious with our workforce, as safety it\u2019s our number one priority. We continue to navigate through these impacts on the operations and supply chain side. But we have become creative problem solvers, and experts in mitigating issues before they become concerns for our customers. Gaining access to sites for installation services has proven to be an issue. But, we continue to manage around any restrictions. Countries like Singapore and Malaysia, Philippines are still struggling with COVID. And we've seen some of these countries in Western Europe tightening back up again. These unfortunate COVID related situations are outside of our control. And however, we continue to work closely with our customers to adhere to health and safety requirements and to make sure that our scheduling of our service departments are as flexible as possible to meet their needs. With that, I'll turn it over to David Fallon to walk us through the financials. David."

                "text": "Thanks, Rob. Turning to Slide 6, this page summarizes our third quarter financial results versus last year. As you can see, net sales were up $91 million or 8.5%, 8.3% when adjusted for a slight foreign exchange tailwind. We continued our strong momentum with orders as Rob mentioned, which were up 15.5% in the third quarter and 10% year-to-date. Adjusted EBITDA increased $43 million or 31% driven by higher sales, improved contribution margin and relatively flat fixed costs converting into a 270 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin. Our sales and profitability performance may translate into strong free cash flow of $129 million, which was up $115 million from last year's third quarter. We'll review some of the drivers of this improved free cash flow in a couple slides. But before leaving this page, we are proud to emphasize that our third quarter adjusted EBITDA related margin and free cash flow figures are all record quarterly highs, demonstrating our continued focus on profitable growth and strong cash flow generation. Turning to Slide 7, this slide summarizes our third quarter segment results, net sales in the Americas were down $14 million or 3%, as growth in our integrated rack solution segment primarily in the channel was more than offset by lower large project sales in our critical infrastructure and solution segment and lower sales in our services and spare segments caused by COVID site access issues. Net sales in APAC increased $56 million or 17% primarily due to continued strong growth in China across most end-markets including data centers, telecommunications and industrials. Geographic locations outside of China in APAC are relatively flat as we continue to deal with some site access challenges in some of those jurisdictions. Net sales and EMEA were up $49 million or 24%, with $7 million driven by a stronger euro, the $42 million or 21% organic growth, somewhat aided by the timing of large projects was spread across several market verticals including colocation data centers, telecommunications and commercial and industrial. From a profitability perspective, adjusted EBITDA margin improved in all three geographic segments but notably in the Americas, where margin increased over 800 basis points from last year's third quarter. A portion of this improvement was driven by strong product mix this quarter. But that was coupled with a lower margin large project last year caused by poor internal execution. But the remainder of the increase was result higher contribution margin from strong execution of purchasing and pricing initiatives and driving lower fixed costs. On a year-to-date basis adjusted EBITDA margin in the Americas has increased over 400 basis points from last year, illustrating the progress we have made with our margin expansion initiatives in a relatively short period of time. Next, moving to Slide 8, this chart bridges third quarter free cash flow from last year. The $115 million increase is primarily driven by lower cash interest pursuant to the debt pay down and refinancing in the first quarter and that is coupled with higher adjusted EBITDA. After beginning the year with the use of cash in the first quarter, if you recall, we used about $203 million of free cash flow in Q1. But since then, we have generated more than $190 million of free cash flow over the last two quarters really indicative of the strong cash generation potential of this business. This free cash flow has allowed us to pay down our ABL by $170 million in the third quarter, while improving our liquidity position from about $450 million at the end of the first quarter to over $650 million at the end of September. Next turning to Slide 9, this page summarizes costs and benefits of a restructuring program, which supports our continuing objective to maintain fixed costs constant while reinvesting in the long-term growth of the business. Pursuant to this program, we recorded a $71 million restructuring reserve in the third quarter, which was primarily related to severance for headcount efficiency and footprint optimization projects may be launched in the fourth quarter in over the next couple of years. In addition, we recorded a $9 million intangible asset impairment charge for trademarks and developed technology in a small business unit we are streamlining. We anticipate additional albeit smaller, restructuring program expenses in both 2021 and 2022 that aren't covered by the third quarter reserve. We estimate $84 million net cash outflow to execute the restructuring program with approximately $16 million of that in 2021. We expect $85 million run rate savings from the program in full year 2023. With those gross savings ramping up in each 2021 and 2022. For next year, we expect over $40 million gross savings from the restructuring program offset by approximately $20 million of additional restructuring expenses not covered by the third quarter reserve. Next, turning to Slide 10, this page summarizes our financial guidance for the fourth quarter. And overarching any expectations for the next several months is the dynamic uncertainty with COVID, which is certainly worsening in many global jurisdictions. Accordingly, our guidance for next quarter assumes that COVID conditions are not significantly change from what we experienced in third quarter. If conditions do become more challenge, our guidance here today could be significantly negatively impacted. Notwithstanding these change in COVID conditions, we do expect strong fourth quarter top line growth of 6% to 8% from last year's fourth quarter and 7% to 9% sequentially from this year's third quarter as we continue to benefit from a record high $1.85 billion backlog at the end of September. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to improve approximately 165 basis points at the midpoint from last year's fourth quarter as contribution margin should increase from purchasing and pricing initiatives and fixed costs although slightly higher than last year, primarily due to growth investment should decline as a percentage of sales. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin when looked at sequentially from the third quarter. It should be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter despite the anticipated higher sales and some of the drivers that include the anticipation of an approximately $30 million increase in fixed costs in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter as the benefits from our COVID-19 cost savings program ramped down, and in addition to higher growth, investment and public company costs. Once again, before moving off this slide, we certainly reiterate that these expected fourth quarter results could be significantly negatively impacted by any worsening COVID-19 conditions. So with that, then I turn it back over to Rob."

                "text": "Thanks, David. Turning to Slide 11, here is a bit more detail regarding our perspective on 2021? We expect cloud, colocation and telecom markets will continue to be healthy as we enter into 2021. Because of COVID, we\u2019re unable to anticipate what the enterprise market will look like. But we anticipate growth and the overall data center landscape. Our backlog should be slightly better heading into 2021 than we thought at the end of last quarter, which provides us good visibility and confidence on the revenue side for the first half of 2021. However, the uncertainty of COVID provides us applause today, more than we were thinking 90 days ago. Certainly, we're not in the business of making predictions on when there will be a vaccine. But we do see this as a very dynamic situation today as David mentioned earlier. As we have seen during this entire pandemic, we are planning for the worst scenario, and working and hoping for the best as things remained very dynamic even today. On the margin side, as we mentioned previously, we are firm believers in the strategy of holding fixed costs constant. This concept is being practiced today. But as mentioned previously, we will continue to invest in R&D and growth investments that will be key for our long-term success. So while we're not providing specific 2021 guidance, at this point, we did want to refresh the commentary we provided to you last quarter. Now, turning to Slide 12, our backlog, fixed cost constant approach we have implemented in our liquidity position are in great shape. We hold a leadership position in a growing industry, and the demand for digital infrastructure to support the vital applications the world needs has never been stronger, we will continue to invest for the future while simultaneously managing it for today. So we are prepared to be even more successful as we emerge from this pandemic. And the world adapts to a post-COVID life. Thank you for being on the call today. Thank you for your support.

And our progress that we've made so far as it relates to rolling out the Vertiv operating system. And again, we do see long-term benefits from that. From a pricing perspective, we continue to get in various parts of the world pricing, and we expect to get pricing again, next year as we go into 2021, whether it's on products or services or our differentiated product sets that we're coming out with, and that's part of the reason why we're investing a lot of money in the what we call the Vertiv product development is to bring those features up and have those innovative solutions that customers are willing to pay a better price or give us a better price.

And we certainly have to point out that, we see that higher fixed costs as investment in the long-term, a lot of that is driven by the DBD spend, R&D spending, and continue to invest in some of the growth markets. But we also anticipate contribution margin to dip a little bit in Q4 versus Q3, which is separate from fixed costs. And that's driven in part by product segment mix. So we see healthy growth, Q3 Q4 in the top line, but it's probably a little bit over balanced to the critical infrastructure and solutions product segment, which has a little bit lower margin than the other two product segments."

Can you elaborate a little bit more on that and market in particular? And I asked because some of the semiconductor and tech hardware companies have been seeing a slowdown in data center spend, doesn't seem like that's Vertiv\u2019s outlets.

What I'd say is a couple things we are seeing strength globally in the colocation and hyper scale market. What tends to happen, though, is that what you might hear from the chip manufacturers doesn't necessarily correlate or connect directly to the demand that we're seeing, partly because while we're building, they're not filling. And so there's some timing differences as that data centers get built, and get deployed, from them then filling with the IT equipment from that perspective. So I don't think, we use those as nothing indicators of where things are going because they're a little bit lagging. What we're seeing on the on the front end of the business."

Are there any investments and working capital or CapEx, we should be cognizant of thinking about it at this point. And then it'll be just announced that dividend but if you could also talk about you, as you're driving that higher free cash flow, how should investors be thinking about the use of their free cash flow?"

So first, on free cash flow I think a good starting point to understand 2021 is to go back to our beginning of the year guidance for 2020 and this is all pre-COVID. But on a pro forma basis, when you adjust for some of the transaction related expenses and also adjust for some of the benefits that we started to receive at the end of the first quarter from the debt refinancing and pay down. We had set a pro forma free cash flow for 2020 was in that $285 million to $300 million.\u2013ssss \u2026$285 million to $300 million range. I think that's a really good starting point for next year. There certainly will be some moving pieces. And one of those is related to the cash outlay pursuant to the restructuring program, which we said was about $60 million, we should receive some benefit from the lower expenses from restructuring. I think that's probably a really good starting point. As it relates to what we are going to do with the cash. Yes, at this point, our intention is to pay down debt."

So apple-to-apples, the $50 million to $70 million that we discussed at the end of the second quarter, after we have completed the initial planning is likely going to be in the $40 million range. So that's a gross savings number. The reason that has declined from when we talked about it three months ago is primarily related to some of the planning on the footprint optimization. So, of course, primary goal of the restructuring is to take cost out. But, we have to do that with very minimal impact on our customers. So as we looked at the plan, we've moved some of the planning out on some of the footprint projects from mid-to-late 2021 into 2022. And so the savings have not changed, the expected savings have actually increased a little bit. But just the timing has moved out from 2021 into 2022."

So that alone would have turned that negative 2.5 to positive, but if you also look at the product segment results for the Americas there also was a headwind for services, which probably contributed about 200 basis points. And in addition, Americas also had a foreign exchange headwind; the other two regions had a tailwind in the third quarter, but because of the Mexican peso, the Brazilian Real that was about a 1% headwind. And looking forward into the fourth quarter and I think we bullet point this on the guidance slide, we are anticipating low single-digit growth in the Americas in the fourth quarter. So we do anticipate a little bit of a rebound there versus what we saw year-over-year in the third quarter."

I guess what I'm missing is, I think you guys have talked about $60 million of temporary cost benefits in 2020, that you were looking to offset? I guess, is the expectation that that full $60 million does come back next year and thus creating a net headwind or how do we think about that?"

So when we look at the restructuring, we do anticipate $40 million of gross savings, we will have additional restructuring expenses of $20 million. So there's a net $20 million savings next year related to restructuring. Separately, we do anticipate some headwinds pursuant to the COVID cost saving program we put in place. If you recall, we anticipated that to be $60 million this year. And we're certainly on track. But of that $60 million we believe $40 million is going to come back into the business. So, those two things certainly offset. But when you look at all of the savings finishes, and the headwinds, our goal and our target is to keep the fixed costs constant. And we purposely on the 2021 slide, we provided some indication that we actually anticipate fixed costs to increase in 2021 versus 2020. And a big driver of that is related to the size of the reinvestment back into R&D and growth investment in the market. So we kind of look at all of these puts and takes fund ably. And when it all boils down to what our fixed costs doing next year, we actually anticipate those to increase a little bit because of that growth investment on a net basis."

So we look at continued investment as part of our Vertiv differentiation going forward is to continue that development cycle and new products.

I know you mentioned you've got some fixed costs that are coming back in Q4. Should we assume that that is that sort of the big driver of that big margin improvement? And then is it possible to sort of think about what that margin would have been kind of on a go forward basis? And just for generally, I guess, do you think about that level of margin, as ultimately sustainable or achievable? Thanks."

So first, I want to reiterate how pleased we are with the progress that we're seeing not only in Americas, but in all the regions as it relates to margin expansion, but in particular, in the Americas. And certainly the 800 basis point improvement versus the third quarter last year was very impressive. But it also improved up 200 basis points from Q2, which is probably more comparable. And from our perspective, heading into Q3, the performance that we saw from the Americas from an EBITDA margin perspective, around 30%, probably was at the upper range of what we anticipated. And there were a lot of things that went the right way in Q3, including product mix, not necessarily between product segments, but within product segments. So as we move to the fourth quarter, we would not anticipate to see an EBTIDA margin in Americas comparable for Q3, we still would see very nice growth from Q4 of last year. But we would anticipate EBITDA margin in Q4 to be more close to Q2. And one of the drivers there for Q4 is that a lot of our growth that we're seeing in Americas and also the other two segments is in that critical infrastructure and solution segment, which does have a little bit lower margin than the other two segments. So we're very hopeful that that contribution margin and the EBITDA margin we saw in Americas is, really pretends what's the come for that segment and the business in general. But just looking out one quarter, we would anticipate that to drop back a little bit."

But, we still generally plan internally for that range. And that's what we would speak to externally. What I will say from a fixed cost perspective, and I want to caveat all this, we are not providing guidance for 2021. Yet, we are still going through the planning, process ourselves. But we thought it prudent to provide some expectations that we see a lot of good R&D and BBD projects for next year, quite frankly, more projects, and we have resources to complete. And we thought it was prudent to continue to invest in those. And as a result, because of the size of that investment, we anticipate fixed costs increased. But from a margin perspective, we would not believe that to be a tailwind. So, impact on margin, we don't believe fixed costs is going to increase as a percentage, as high as the top line will increase year-over-year. So even though fixed costs will increase, we don't think that would be a significant headwind as it relates to EBITDA margins."

I think one of your competitors commented actually that they were somewhat more bullish on enterprise outlook, both near-term and medium-term. And I just want to parcel out you did talk about sort of big project slippage. Was that on the enterprise side or was that sort of on the colo cloud side? Just want to understand, just yes, so that's a good question. And maybe then just a little bit more color on what's happening in small and medium business side of things?"

On the enterprise side, what we look at is, as we really go to this hybrid world of on prem and cloud, they might be referring to some of the edge strength that we are seeing in some of the enterprise, certainly we're seeing a lot of activity. When we say we're not, enterprise still hasn't recovered, they're just not pulling the trigger, there's certainly a lot of activity out there that we have visibility to projects that that will break at some point in time. From the small to medium business, we did see a little bit of growth in what we call our IRS business, which is driven by the channel side of things. So we're really happy with the execution that we're doing there. But we just haven't seen and if you see some of the numbers out with CBW and so forth, people are still experiencing negative growth, about beginning to see potential light at the end of the tunnel. That being said, if COVID continues to persist, I think that affects that that particular area as we go forward. Our plan there as a company was to take share in the channel and grow and I think that's how we were able to kind of, I would say outperform most of the companies are doing as it relates to channel by taking share with innovative new products."

And I'm just curious to know, do you think that the current market, it sounds like you've seen some good activity? And it sounds like you're sort of encouraged by that? Do you think that there's been a change in the sort of the balance between on prem and colo business clouds for the enterprise segment?

Once a life, we've been seeing a lot of activity in the enterprise side of things, which would indicate at some point in time, when they pull the trigger, that things will move forward, we haven't really seen a drastic move one way or the other to, the cloud, or on prem. And certainly things like teams and zoom and blue jeans and things like that are driving a lot of internet traffic, which is driving the need for more demand, and bandwidth and latency from that perspective. But we continue to see that the enterprise looks at various applications, and those ones that are readily and easily moved to the cloud they do. And still seeing the advent of on prem and BH data centers. They have other phenomena that we've talked about in the past is really this data, kind of staying within the country or within the region. So we're seeing a lot of builds in Europe and other parts of the world for people basically keeping that data, certain sets of data within their region within their country, that type of thing. So we'll continue to see those types of builds as well. But I think what we're all waiting for and looking to is once there's a vaccine, whatever that might be, and enterprise gets back, and we have a kind of a new way of I would call it even a hybrid working from home and working from the office will drive those projects and began to move those off that center."

And our announcement that we talked about, the first product that we're working together on is really about using multiple sources in kind of a micro grid fashion for data center. So we select, whether it's solar or whether it\u2019s used fuel cells are pull off the grid. And we see that just as the beginning of some of the collaboration and good things that we believe we can do together. So I think when you put Vertiv and Honeywell together both with a global footprint, we can offer the customers and take advantage of a lot of the really good software that Honeywell has and management systems coupled with equipment and get better performance and help people reach their PUEs and reach better their carbon footprint as well."

When the last time we spoke in early May, everyone was still trying to determine what the implications of COVID were going to be and exactly what type of recession we were going to have. Well, today, 3 months later, while some things are more clear, there are also many things that are still not clear. What is clear, however, is how Vertiv is executing during this time. As many of you know, one of my mantras in business is growing while holding fixed costs constant. And while that's easy in theory, it's not so easy in practice. What I can tell you is that both Rob and Dave Fallon have fully embraced the concept and are deploying it within Vertiv in an aggressive manner. One of my other beliefs is achieving 2 seemingly conflicting objectives at the same time. Where this seems difficult, it is, in fact, very doable. Inside of Vertiv, we're employing the same mindset by managing our costs very closely, but at the same time, we've been ramping up R&D spending so we continue innovating for our customers today and tomorrow. We're also working on strategy development. Just a few week ago, Rob's team went through a week-long strategy review that I participated in for its entirety. Don't worry, it was all remote. There is absolutely no shortage of ideas on how to grow our top and bottom line. Now there's a lot of work to do to bring this to life, but it sure was a great starting point for the company. We can't know for sure the economic environment globally over the next several months, but I am very confident in our ability to navigate these waters and come out the other side a significantly better company. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob."

                "text": "Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the slide, I want to tell you about how proud I am of the Vertiv team. Serving customers during the pandemic has not been without its challenges. Employees across the company and located in countries across the globe have addressed issues of all kinds brought on by COVID. And they've done it creatively, they've done it energetically and they've done it passionately. I couldn't ask for a better team, and I'm truly grateful to them and for how they have always put the customer first. Let's get into the slides. On Slide 4, overall, the demand side of our business held up as orders were up 5% organically from Q2 2019. Last quarter, we talked about exiting with an all-time high backlog of $1.6 billion. And now I'm proud and happy to report that our backlog is even greater than that at about approximately $1.8 billion. We will talk over the next few slides about both the supply and the demand side of our business. From a profitability standpoint, we delivered $145 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is relatively flat from last year's Q2. Although Q2 had $128 million lower sales than Q2 of 2019, we managed our contribution margins very well and held our cost in line, as Dave Cote mentioned in his opening comments. We had approximately $30 million year-over-year of favorable cost actions delivered in the quarter, which David Fallon will elaborate on later. From a liquidity standpoint, we had a very strong quarter, ending at $530 million, and we generated over $60 million of free cash flow. Next, on this slide, we do want to provide some range for expected Q3 performance. We are anticipating implications of COVID to continue to fluctuate, but we expect our organic sales to be up between 4% and 6%, and our adjusted EBITDA will be up 10% at the midpoint from Q3 of last year. So while the dynamics can change, we did want to share with you what we are currently seeing playing out in Q3. More on this topic later. Finally, we want to add just a bit of color around 2021. As we see things right now, the demand side is holding up, and our backlog should be robust as we exit the end of this year. We know the dynamics with COVID could ultimately change the top line, but what is in our control is our cost. In Q3, we will be announcing [restructuring] activities that will save us approximately $50 million to $70 million in 2021, with a cash cost to execute of approximately $50 million to $70 million. We are fine-tuning the details, but we feel confident about the programs that underpin these numbers. Turning to Slide 5. We used this slide with our Board last week as a heat map of sorts to illustrate the pockets of strength within each region. The chart is simple, but it relays the real-time view we have on the demand side of things. It is qualitative in nature and to fix our view on the level of health and activity in each of the markets we serve. We continue to see a strong level of activity in every region in the cloud and colocation market, as indicated by the 6 green buttons in the first 2 top rows. Emerging vital applications such as online education, telemedicine, video and gaming are benefiting our cloud and colocation customers, and that surge in demand is benefiting us as well. In contrast to the cloud and colo business, we see the enterprise and small to medium business continuing to be challenged by COVID, as indicated by the red and yellow buttons in row 3. This segment is spending some money. We have started to see a resurgence from the segment in China, but overall, this classic customer is not spending as they did prior to COVID. Switching to telecom side of things, both Asia and Americas is strong right now. China has gotten on the 5G bandwagon in a major way, and our telecom customers in the U.S. continue to invest in their network, as you can see, indicated by the 2 green buttons in row 4. Finally, our C&I business, more often than not, as we've always said, will track [indiscernible] approximately GDP over the longer run. But sometimes, the quarterly timing can be different. While this segment has held up better than expected, things are relatively flat in this space. So certainly, some puts and takes, but overall, when you consider our mix of data center business, Vertiv is seeing positive growth. The applications people use every day continue to be more and more vital, following the onset of COVID, and those applications need to be processed, stored and transmitted. And all of this continues to be a great backdrop for our business. Moving on to Slide 6. To reiterate, the overall demand is strong and as evidenced by our strong order rates and record backlog. While our channel business is soft due to the enterprise and small and medium business segment being down, our larger project-based orders rates are on track. One thing I haven't touched on yet, though, is site access. Site access in some of the markets is very challenging. We see this continuing to be an area of uncertainty, as governments control access to countries and localities and ultimately, customers control our ability to deliver and install. Singapore, for example, continues to be almost entirely shut down from a data center standpoint. In India, things fluctuate day-to-day and sometimes even an hour-to-hour basis. On the supply side, the majority of our operations are running normally, and we continue to ramp production. My prior comment on India is appropriate from both the standpoint of demand and supply, and Mexico continues to be a daily work item for us as we address the labor issue. Our customers are experiencing constraints by trade industries, which we continue to work through. COVID has strengthened our proficiency in anticipating potential roadblocks and proactively mitigating issues before they become a concern. With that, I'll turn it over to Dave Fallon to walk us through the financials. David?"

                "text": "Thanks, Rob. Turning to Slide 7. This page summarizes our second quarter financial results versus last year. Net sales were down $128 million or 11%, including $28 million due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency, as most global currencies are weaker versus the U.S. dollar compared to last year, including the euro and the RMB, which represent approximately 60% of our foreign currency exposure. The remaining $100 million reduction in net sales was primarily driven by Americas and EMEA, each organically down double digits as a result of COVID-19 and year-over-year timing of larger projects. Despite the $128 million reduction in net sales, second quarter adjusted EBITDA declined just $2 million and actually increased $5 million when adjusted for foreign currency. Fixed costs were down $35 million from last year's second quarter, primarily as the result of COVID-19 cost actions implemented at the beginning of the quarter, and we still anticipate an approximate $60 million full year benefit from COVID-19 cost actions compared to our beginning of the year guidance, including $35 million in the second quarter, $15 million in the third quarter and $10 million in the fourth quarter. Second quarter contribution margin improved year-over-year due to continued progress with both pricing and productivity initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 150 basis points from last year, primarily driven by this improved contribution margin percentage. Second quarter free cash flow, as we move farthest to the right, improved $128 million from last year's second quarter, in part due to $59 million lower cash interest resulting from the significant debt paydown pursuant to the SPAC transaction and the subsequent debt refinancing. We will review other drivers of higher year-over-year free cash flow in a couple of slides. Next, turning to Slide 8. This page summarizes our second quarter segment results. Organic net sales in the Americas were down [$79 million] or 14%, primarily driven by the continued negative impact from COVID-19 and from the normal variability of year-over-year timing of larger projects, estimated at about $8 million. It was a very similar story in EMEA, where organic net sales declined $32 million or 13%. EMEA was also negatively impacted by COVID-19 and by approximately $15 million from normal variability of larger projects. Organic net sales in APAC increased $11 million, with between $15 million and $20 million of this increase due to the timing of larger projects. Otherwise, relatively flat year-over-year organic net sales in APAC were driven by double-digit growth in China, which represents between 60% to 70% of APAC's top line, and this growth in China was offset by double-digit declines in the rest of Asia, including India, demonstrating that although China seems to be transitioning from the negative effects of COVID-19, certain other geographies within APAC continue to be challenged. From a profitability perspective, adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of sales, increased across the board in all regions, primarily driven by improved contribution margin in both the Americas and EMEA and from lower fixed costs as a percentage of sales in APAC, as fixed costs in that region declined while net sales were relatively flat. Next, turning to Slide 9. The chart on this page bridges second quarter free cash flow from last year. But before reviewing free cash flow, we do want to reiterate our direction from the first quarter earnings call that we continue to hold no concerns related to liquidity, and we're actually incrementally more optimistic based upon the $84 million increase in liquidity during the quarter. We anticipate our liquidity position to grow sequentially at the end of each of the third and fourth quarters based on our expectation of strong free cash flow generation in the second half of the year consistent with timing in prior years. Now returning to the chart. Second quarter free cash flow of $62 million increased $128 million from last year's second quarter, driven by $45 million higher net income despite a $22 million increase in noncash charges, including a $12 million ERP impairment. A significant driver of higher net income was lower interest expense, driven by the SPAC transaction and subsequent debt refinancing. And of course, we had a related $59 million reduction in cash interest, which certainly contributed to the higher year-over-year free cash flow. Cash used for [working capital] declined $44 million, but a good portion of this benefit in the quarter was due to the timing of favorable cash receipts at the end of June, we estimate between $20 million and $30 million that we otherwise expected to receive in the third quarter. Second quarter free cash flow also benefited from lower capital expenditures, but a good portion of this reduction was also due to timing as we deferred CapEx investment to the second half of the year based on the COVID-19 uncertainty we were managing at the beginning of the quarter. Next, turning to Slide 10. This page summarizes our financial guidance for the third quarter, as we illustrated in the earnings release. Although uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 has certainly mitigated since we spoke in early May, there is still lack of sufficient visibility to provide specific financial guidance beyond a few months. Accordingly, we provide our expectations for only third quarter, and this guidance assumes that what we experienced in July continues through August and September, which, of course, is subject to change based upon uncertainty with COVID-19. We are effectively approaching financial guidance for this year, 1 quarter at a time. Based upon what we know today, we expect third quarter organic net sales to increase between 4% and 6% from last year's third quarter. And although projected organic growth from prior year differs by region, with Americas expected to be relatively flat and APAC and EMEA expected to grow mid- to upper single digits, all 3 regions should grow sequentially from the second quarter in upper single digits. This sequential growth is not driven by seasonality as our third quarter net sales declined sequentially from the second quarter in each of the last 2 years. Of course, we expect third quarter net sales in all 3 regions to continue to be negatively influenced by COVID-19 and our top line results will be dependent upon access to customer sites and our customers' ability and willingness to accept shipments. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA of approximately $150 million at the midpoint, 10% higher than last year's third quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin to expand approximately 90 basis points at the midpoint, primarily driven by relatively flat fixed cost, fixed cost constant, while top line is growing mid-single digits. Comparing our third quarter guidance to our second quarter results, although top line is expected to grow approximately 10% sequentially at the midpoint, adjusted EBITDA is expected to expand less than 5%. Relatively lower profit growth is driven by higher projected fixed costs in the third quarter versus the second quarter, primarily due to a $20 million reduction in the benefit from COVID-19 cost actions. In addition, we plan that despite the uncertainty related to COVID-19 to continue the ramp-up of R&D and growth initiative spending in the third quarter. Third quarter contribution margin as a percentage of sales is expected to remain relatively consistent with the second quarter. With that said, I turn it back over to Rob."

                "text": "Thanks, David. Turning to Slide 11. Here's a bit more detail regarding our perspective on 2021. From our radar screen right now, we see the cloud, colocation and telecom markets continuing to be pretty healthy entering into 2021. It's clearly too early to call what the enterprise market will look like, but the total data center landscape we are still expecting to see a growth. Our record backlog of $1.8 billion gives us good visibility and confidence on the revenue side. And towards the back half of 2021, we will start seeing the R&D investments pay off with even more products and solutions hitting the market. On the margin side, as we've discussed several times, we are firm believers and practicers of holding fixed cost constant, and those efforts will be in full swing during 2021. To this end, we plan to announce restructuring actions in Q3, which we will expect to reduce fixed costs by approximately $50 million to $70 million, plus additional variable cost benefit. These projects are varied and are entering into the final scoping stages. To support these fixed cost reduction projects, we anticipate incurring cash costs between $50 million and $70 million, including capital, and we will evaluate these cash costs for a likely restructuring reserve to be recorded in third quarter. So while it's too early, we did want to provide you with a glimpse of what we potentially are seeing play out in 2021, at least based on what we know today. Now turning to Slide 12 and in closing. I want to thank you for your support over the past quarter and in the quarters to come. We participate in a great industry where we have a leadership position and never has critical digital infrastructure to support vital application been so important as it is now. Our backlog, the fixed cost constant approach we have implemented and our liquidity positions are in great shape as we continue to operate during this dynamic time. We continue to invest in the future while simultaneously managing for today. This strategic approach will prepare us to even be more successful when we emerge from this pandemic, and the world adapts to a new normal. Thank you for your support. Stay healthy.

And we certainly have learned a new way of doing our business while doing things virtually. So that $20 million, we certainly would target to keep out of the business. But just a quick point. With the macro goal of keeping fixed costs constant, we will target to even offset the other $40 million. So that $40 million, if it does come back into the business, our planning heading into 2021 would be to identify other reductions to offset it.

The 5G projects, I would imagine they would be somewhat lumpy, maybe not as visible as traditional data center, but I really don't know. It's a newer market, obviously. But can you help us understand what those projects typically look like? And how they might differ from a traditional data center project?"

So they put tens of billions of dollars into doing that. Those projects tend to be smaller, but tend to be tens of thousands of sites. And basically, with 5G, what you have to do is go into that cell tower, upgrade the power system, because 5G does require more power and maybe upgrade the thermal. So the opportunity for us is lots of little sites, but tens of thousands of those. And that's what we're seeing certainly happen in China, and we participate really well in China when it comes to the 5G rollout. Same thing in the U.S., what you're finding is the networks get very constrained because of all the work-from-home, school-from-home. People are upgrading those networks, upgrading, maintaining and upgrading the equipment there. And 5G is, as you know, kind of a race between China and the U.S. of who can get there faster. So we're enjoying that, and I think that trend will continue, not necessarily lumpy, but pretty steady over the next couple of years."

Implicit in the guide is effectively that fixed cost will be flat this year versus last year. And based on the leverage across the 3 regions, we would anticipate EBITDA margins to increase globally. And that's even with contribution margin likely staying relatively flat. So we would anticipate higher adjusted EBITDA margins to be spread across all 3 regions."

The big projects ebb and flow, and sometimes we talk about that and say, we had a big project in EMEA this year, and we didn't -- that didn't repeat itself. But what I would say is what we're seeing is strength, as we talked about, Nicole, and hyperscale, which tend to be larger projects, and we're seeing that not just in any particular region, but all the regions. And what's going to be important for us going forward for the second half is how site access and how delivery and how the availability of the trades are there to be able to deliver. There's certainly, as you can see by our backlog, a pent-up demand and trade constraints can be a problem, inside access can be a problem. But in general, we'll see for certain a larger Q3 and then a larger Q4."

In the context, just given how strong the performance was in the second quarter and the favorable revenue guide for Q3, I thought that the adjusted EBITDA guide seemed -- actually seemed a little light as you have margin on a quarter-on-quarter basis actually going down about 75 basis points or so despite sequential sales growth. So I'm just wondering, I know, obviously, you talked a little bit about the COVID cost actions, the $30 million that benefited the second quarter. And I guess I would have thought -- I know you talked about this a couple of seconds ago, but a little bit more would have kind of carried into the third quarter. So I'm just wondering, to what extent are you -- are you giving yourselves just some room to maneuver here? Or is there something in particular that we should be thinking about that would lead to that kind of a margin performance in the third quarter?"

We likely will provide ranges, but we're generally comfortable at the midpoint. And I can help you with the $150 million adjusted EBITDA at the midpoint and how that walks from the $145 million from the second quarter. So being a finance guy, we try to get things as quantitative as possible. So we have about $100 million increase in sales from Q2 to Q3. And if you throw a 40% to 45% contribution margin against that, you get about $40 million, $45 million of benefit. And the headwind is certainly going to be on the fixed cost side as we talked about on -- in the prepared remarks. And that could be in that $35 million plus range. And $20 million of that is going to be related to lower benefits from the COVID actions. And these are things that we benefited from in Q2 that we won't benefit in -- from -- in Q3, including furloughs and in certain geographies, we were able to receive some government subsidies. So that's a good portion of the higher fixed costs. The other component is our commitment to continue to invest in strategic initiatives. And this is something that we talked about on the last couple of calls. Heading into this year, our plan was to continue to invest in R&D. As we continue to increase that spend as a percentage of sales, we continue to invest in markets that we believe have higher potential and profitable growth, including the channel. In addition, we have some digital projects that we continue to invest in. So the spending for those strategic initiatives ramp-up in the third quarter. And that explains the remainder of the fixed costs increase sequentially from Q2 to Q3."

You mentioned that you're less worried about -- even less worried about liquidity, given the outperformance on cash flow in the second quarter. So the implication of that is that, that $60 million of cash was not pulled forward from what you otherwise would have expected to generate in the second half. And I know you talked about you're still expecting a good second half. But it sounds like this is really like just incremental to what you would have expected when you were making your budget, say, at the beginning of the year. Is that fair?"

And when we look at cash flow, we certainly error on the side of being a little bit more conservative. But our second quarter free cash flow performance certainly was encouraging. I think at this time in May, we hint it towards maybe a slightly negative free cash flow for Q2. So we certainly outperformed that. I did mention some of the favorable performance was based on timing of cash receipts. So we received between $20 million and $30 million literally in the last day of the month that we had anticipated to receive sometime mid-July. So that's helped and certainly would borrow from Q3. But even with that taken into account, our Q2 free cash flow was better than what we anticipated. And certainly, lends to the optimism that we have both for liquidity and related free cash flow generation for Q3 and Q4."

And perhaps you could also speak more specifically to your expectations for the hyperscale portion of your business. And how you're thinking about the sustainability of that end market which certainly has a lot of good secular growth over the long term, as how Dave has described it in the past. But there's some debate in the investment community about whether some of the spending going on in hyperscale this year is pull ahead of demand."

                "speaker": "Robert Johnson",
                "text": "Mark, this is Rob Johnson. I'll start off here. First of all, what gives us confidence in the continued strong backlog going into 2021 is our visibility in both our pipeline, which is very strong globally. And what we're seeing from an orders and expectation for orders growth. So we do expect to see orders grow in the second half. And -- so that gives us the confidence going through, those 2 things that I look at, which pipeline is a huge indicator of where things are going. I can't anticipate what's going to happen on the enterprise and small to medium business, but that's even a plus if they come -- the recovery comes faster, I would say, in the second half. As it relates to hyperscale, what we're seeing globally is a combination of things. It's not just the hyperscale building out to build out. There's a lot of data sovereignty. You've seen a lot of stuff around people wanting data to stay in their country. So what we're seeing is a proliferation of data centers, and we'll continue to see that really data centers in-country, for-country type of thing. And there's a lot of build out going on in Europe. Europe is red hot when it comes to that. Certainly seeing it in the Middle East, Africa. And then just really around the world, South America. So we continue to see data is not slowing down, the rate of growth of data that has to be processed and stored. So we're not looking at this as a bubble that hyperscale is building out or colocation is building out too much capacity. From our lens, the next 18, 24 months, we see just a strong demand and a need for data centers. There was a pause as we talked about last year, a little bit of digestion, as I'd say. I'd say we're probably a little bit behind now in order to fulfill the capacity that's needed. So we do expect to see hyperscale grow. But we lump hyperscale and colocation together because a lot of the colocation companies, certainly outside of the U.S., are providing that capacity for those hyperscalers."

I think that was just from a cyclical and end market perspective, but taking share within channel has been one of the opportunities the company has focused on. Has that share gain opportunity been disruptive because of the COVID challenges and some of that end market weakness? Or do you still feel confident about the company's ability to take share within the channel business over time?"

Pre-COVID, we felt really good about our execution in the channel on a global basis that we were taking share, and we're doing that through providing innovative products and new solutions. We've had a plethora of launches and we'll continue to launch throughout this year and broaden our scope of offering of innovative products and solutions, as well as being that easy-to-do, easy-button-to-go-to company. And being less distributed or, I would call, under distributed, not over distributed, like some of our competition and picking who we want to do business with has really helped us concentrate, focus and gain share and get closer and tighter with them. So what I would say is while the overall channel has been impacted by the small and medium business, we expect that to come back at some point in time, and we'll continue to execute and be in a much stronger position because we continue to launch new products and programs in the channel. So I'm very bullish on a global basis that we'll see, as the recovery comes back, us doing what we said we're going to do, and that's take share and grow in some new categories in the channel space."

And I apologize if I just missed it, I didn't catch an update on what COVID may have done to fundamentals in the second quarter. Is there any more quantitative or qualitative color you can provide about how COVID may be impacting your ability to complete projects in 2Q or in the 3Q guidance from a revenue and a cost perspective?"

And certainly, if you look at lower year-over-year sales, those are a lot easier to attribute directly to COVID. I would say, universally, if you look at our production and operations that we had a minimal impact, being able to procure supply and produce product and we had very little operational issues, if you will. So we didn't specifically call out a dollar impact on the top line related to COVID. And that's primarily because we look at everything that we're dealing with today as kind of fungible with COVID-19. So overall, I think, organically, our sales were off $100 million versus last year. One of the things that we called out specifically in the first quarter year-over-year was the impact of large projects. And that certainly impacted us in Q2, but it was more regional based. If you look at it overall, we probably only had about a $5 million headwind from the timing of large projects from last year's second quarter. So if you want to attribute the remainder reduction of the $95 million to COVID, I wouldn't stop you, but it's really hard for us to specifically say what subcomponents of that $90 million is COVID or that we otherwise would have been able to deliver to customers."

Before I turn it over to Rob Johnson, I want to begin with a few opening remarks. As we spoke last time, and as many of you know, I was fortunate to be able to work for Honeywell for about 16 years. Those who invested with us made a great return. That performance was marked by consistent annual improvements in the people, processes and portfolio of the businesses that made up Honeywell. We did all the seed planting for new products, services, process improvement and other growth initiatives needed to perform well for a long time. The world is in a very different place than when we spoke a couple of months ago. But those opening remarks stay true, whether we are in a period of economic expansion or economic contraction. If you look at our success at Honeywell, it really took off after the Great Recession. And I attribute that success largely to the fact that we continue to implement an operating system, we drove technology investments, and we planted seeds even during that difficult time. Why do I bring it up? Because we're doing that same kind of seed planting at Vertiv. Now some of you may conflate our withdrawal of guidance even in the face of good orders growth, with the liquidity scenarios we've included, and conclude we see a serious problem looming. That would be an error. They are 2 entirely separate points. We've withdrawn guidance because we can't be sure we can ship given government shutdown of facilities for us and suppliers at various times. Additionally, our service people sometimes aren't allowed access to facilities. Our credibility matters greatly to us. And we don't want to guide to numbers we may not be able to deliver even in the face of strong orders. Totally separately, we have included a couple of liquidity scenarios to demonstrate that even if sales fell to $4 billion or even in a 25% sales decline, we will be just fine. It's not a forecast, it's an attempt to make you feel comfortable that we're just fine. Combining these 2 separate points, in the erroneous conclusion that we are forecasting disaster is, well, erroneous. This time has been difficult for everyone. But it also has demonstrated how important data centers and the edge are to our society. It is clearly critical infrastructure and reaffirmation this is a good industry. We have a great position in that good industry. And even at this difficult time, we are investing in the future. Based on how we're running the business during extraordinarily difficult times, including our own customer focus while still seed planting, I am just as excited today as I was 3 months ago about our future. Now I'll turn over the call to Rob who can take you through the business in a little more detail. Rob?"

                "text": "Thank you, Dave, and welcome, everyone, today. As I said on the last call, I really value the advice that Dave has provided to the team since he's been engaged with Vertiv. And I especially appreciate his counsel now as we navigate through these pandemic times. Before I walk you through the slide, it goes without saying that we have been proactive in protecting the safety of our employees and our customers. We've implemented precautionary measures from temperature screening to increased cleaning and disinfecting of facilities to social distancing at work, just to name a few. Additionally, our service technicians have followed Vertiv's safety protocols and adhered to additional safety measures adopted at customer sites. Safety of our Vertiv employees and our customers has been and will continue to be at the forefront of everything we do. I want to thank the Vertiv employees for their hard work during Q1 and give a shout out to the manufacturing workers and the service technicians who continue to provide products and services to our customers and conduct day-to-day business with the utmost of caution amidst COVID-19. I appreciate their steadfast commitment to Vertiv. It's their unwavering dedication that has allowed us to serve our customers, enable those customers to provide technology and vital applications to the world that they rely on more than ever. To all of our employees on the front line, I say thank you. Let's take a look at the slides, starting with Slide 4. Overall, the demand side of our business was very robust in Q1 as orders were up 13% compared to the first quarter of 2019. We exited Q1 with a record high backlog of $1.6 billion, which can be attributed to cloud, colocation and telecom customers around the world who are delivering vital applications so students could be educated online, hospitals and health care facilities could function, workers could work from home and businesses experiencing a surge in demand during the stay-at-home mandate could deliver. On the revenue side, despite almost all of our manufacturing facilities being up and running, we have been deemed essential. We were still adversely impacted by COVID as many of our facilities are still dealing with some level of disruption. Additionally, Q1 of 2019 had a few large projects complete, which made a difficult comparison. In Q1, we proactively implemented cost actions to protect the business having seen and felt the impact of COVID in China before things spread to other parts of the world. These cost actions are expected to generate $60 million of benefit by the end of the year. David will address liquidity later, but we feel good about our position today and know that even under a variety of downside scenarios that Dave spoke to, we will be able to maintain our strong liquidity base. We stay close to our customers and continually monitor and comply with directives of governments around the world as they relate to pandemic actions. This pandemic has put us and others in a position where things will remain dynamic and unpredictable over the next several months. Because of this, we are withdrawing our previous guidance. I can tell you this, however, Vertiv has been designated as an essential business. We see strong demand for our products and services. We are taking short-term and long-term actions to make sure we continue to serve our customers. We are nimble, flexible and responsive. We are ready to adapt, react and serve in ways that will be needed for today and tomorrow and in the future. Turning to Slide 5. There's a lot of content on this slide, so I won't hit every bullet. But we wanted to provide you with additional knowledge and deeper insight about our business. The first quarter COVID impact of $80 million was roughly 60% supply based and 40% demand based. On the supply side, I'm proud to tell you that all of our facilities, with the exception of a small plant in China, are back up and running. Now, not all of our facilities are running at 100% because there are still many things they are struggling with: parts issues, logistics constraints, but nonetheless, we are able to operate at some level in every region. The supply side is aggressively being monitored on a daily basis as issues arise. Whether it's government health inspections, supplier output, logistics and many more, there's just a myriad of obstacles that our team has to continue to overcome on a daily basis. The Vertiv team has done an outstanding job to carefully and methodically resolve these issues as they arise in places all over the globe, so we continue to supply products to our customers and assist them with their services needs. Moving on to the demand side. Certainly, the headline number of orders being up 13% is great accomplishment of the sales and marketing team. Each region grew orders substantially with EMEA leading the way at 26% year-over-year growth in Q1. The orders were largely driven by cloud, large colocation and telecommunication companies. The area where we saw softness was within the small- and medium-sized business that is served by our IT channel partners who have been adversely affected by the pandemic. As this segment of the business starts to come back, we expect to see demand continue. Turning to Slide 6. As I mentioned previously, we were in early identifying, addressing and implementing a number of different cost actions for Q1. The entire leadership team and Board of Directors took a 10% base pay cut. While this may not be new news to most of you, what you didn't know is that they volunteered to do this. I didn't even have to ask them. Additionally, merit increases for employees were halted for 2020. The 401(k) match in the U.S. has been stopped, and every department has been tasked with a discretionary 15% cut. Furthermore, Dave mentioned in his opening remarks about use of furloughs, and we have implemented those across every function and every jurisdiction where it's allowed. Employees have been understanding and supportive of our efforts to utilize these measures to make sure Vertiv stays strong and financially healthy. These actions and a few others will contribute to $60 million of P&L benefit during the rest of 2020. We are also being aggressive on the revenue side. Our sales and service teams are strengthening ties with the customer, providing updates and reassurances to them regularly. We have enhanced our marketing message and increased our social media presence as we look for additional ways to reach those in need of the products and services that we provide. The selfless nature of our 19,000-plus employees is a testament to the culture of the organization. Our desire to be present and helpful to those who need us, our willingness to work while we battle COVID-19, I am proud of the way Vertiv and its team have acted and reacted to all the unknowns we faced in Q1. With that, I'll turn it over to David Fallon to give a deeper dive into the [indiscernible]"

                "text": "Thanks, Rob. Turning to Slide 7. This page provides a summary of our debt structure and our current and expected future liquidity. Starting on the left-hand side, we remind investors that we were able to time the SPAC transaction and debt refinancing quite well with neither likely available to us in this current market environment. However, as a result, we possess a rather simple long-term debt structure with a $2.2 billion term loan maturing in 2027, with $1 billion at a variable rate, currently at 3.4% and $1.2 billion swapped to a fixed rate of 4.1%, resulting in a relatively modest annual cash interest run rate of less than $90 million, which is inclusive of interest on our $455 million asset-based lending facility or our ABL. Now counterparties to our ABL are all large, well-known, reputable banks. Hence, we believe there is little counterparty risk related to credit in our ABL. Our term loan contains no financial maintenance covenants, and our ABL contains only 1 springing financial maintenance covenant if our availability falls below $45.5 million or 10% of the total facility. The springing financial maintenance covenant is a fixed charge coverage ratio that must be greater than 1 and which was at 3.7 at the end of March. Hence, we believe there is minimal risk of violating this covenant even under significant downside scenarios. The right-hand side of this page summarizes our liquidity, a strong $446 million at the end of the first quarter including $289 million of nonrestricted cash and $157 million available on our ABL. We will review the components of negative free cash flow in the first quarter in a few slides. But $100 million of that use of cash was pursuant to discrete payments related to the SPAC transaction and cash interest, which will not recur going forward. We continue to expect positive free cash flow for the full year including slightly negative in the second quarter and significantly positive in the third and fourth quarters. This projected quarterly cash flow cadence is consistent with prior years, as we generally use cash in the first quarter and second quarter free cash flow is generally somewhat modest due to lower collections from lighter seasonal first quarter sales. Normally, a large percentage of our full year free cash flow is generated in the second half of the year. We feel quite good about our liquidity projections, even under unlikely significant downside scenarios. For example, even if sales are modeled to decline an improbable of 25% from last year. And as Dave mentioned at the outset and just for avoidance of doubt, we provide this illustrative downside scenario simply to demonstrate confidence in our liquidity and not as any form of directional guidance. But even under this extreme scenario, our projected liquidity low point in 2020, still does not drop below $300 million, as lower adjusted EBITDA is partially offset by a recovery of working capital, which runs at about 22.5% of sales. And for further clarity, this $300 million low point is not a year-end liquidity figure, but this would be projected to occur at some point intra-month in the fourth quarter, as our liquidity ebbs and flows intra-quarter, but is generally highest at each quarter and year-end. In addition, under this and any significant downside sales scenario, our liquidity is also negatively impacted by lower collateral on the ABL as lower sales reduce eligible accounts receivable supporting the borrowing base. Of course, this modeling scenario also assumes that customers continue to pay amount owed to us in a timely manner, and we pay suppliers similarly. As of today, we have not experienced any significant collection issues. In addition, our modeling does not assume the benefit of any additional cost actions, which certainly would be likely in a significant sales downturn nor does this scenario include the benefit of any potential additional liquidity actions, including contractually extending supplier payment terms, establishing local lines of credit or even though we do not foresee a dire need at this point, opportunistically accessing debt financing markets. Next slide, turning to Slide 8. This page summarizes our first quarter financial results versus last year's first quarter. Net sales were down $158 million or 15%, including approximately $80 million due to COVID-19 and $19 million from unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, as most global currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar in the first quarter. The remaining $59 million reduction was anticipated heading into the quarter, primarily driven by large projects in last year's first quarter, predominantly in Americas and EMEA. Adjusted EBITDA declined $40 million from last year due to the lower top line, and partially offset by lower fixed costs from prior year restructuring activity. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined 260 basis points primarily due to the lower leverage of fixed costs. And to the far right, free cash flow declined $158 million from last year's first quarter, including $100 million combined due to discrete payments pursuant to the SPAC transaction and cash interest that will not recur going forward. We will provide a more fulsome explanation of changes in free cash flow in just a couple of slides. Finally, on this slide, we include a note at the bottom explaining that pursuant to our debt refinancing at the beginning of March, where we raised the new term loan and concurrently paid off several high interest rate notes, we recognized $174 million loss on extinguishment of debt. $99 million of this loss was a noncash write-off of deferred financing fees and $75 million was a cash payment for the early redemption of the notes. Neither of these items is included in adjusted EBITDA and the cash payment for early redemption or the $75 million is included in financing activities in the statement of cash flow. Next, turning to Slide 9. This page summarizes our first quarter segment results. I won't delve into the details, but COVID-19 certainly negatively influenced each of the 3 regions. We disclosed the top line impact for each region on Page 5 of this presentation, including $50 million of the $80 million in APAC, as China was virtually shut down in February. However, excluding the impact of COVID-19 and adjusted for $8 million of foreign exchange, APAC sales actually increased $23 million from last year's first quarter primarily on the strength of telecom and larger colocation and hyperscale customers. Net sales in the other 2 regions were down from prior year, even excluding COVID-19 and foreign exchange primarily driven by several larger projects that shipped in the first quarter of 2019. Lower adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA - adjusted EBITDA margin in each region was primarily driven by lower year-over-year net sales. Next, turning to Slide 10. This chart bridges first quarter free cash flow from last year. While we have historically used cash in the first quarter, free cash flow this year was further negatively impacted by lower sales from COVID-19, which significantly contributed to the $41 million increase in inventory and a $40 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA. In addition, cash interest in this year's first quarter was actually $33 million higher than last year, as we accelerated accrued interest payments on the notes we paid off pursuant to the debt refinancing. And we were also negatively impacted by the timing of interest payments on the former term loan. Of course, on a go-forward basis, our quarterly cash interest will be significantly reduced as reflected by the $79 million run rate adjustment in the green bar farthest to the right. First quarter free cash flow was also negatively impacted by $21 million of discrete costs pursuant to the SPAC transaction. So in summary, on a pro forma run rate basis, we used about $103 million of free cash flow in the first quarter with approximately $80 million directly or indirectly attributable to COVID-19. And despite this negative free cash flow in the first quarter, we still expect significantly positive free cash flow for the full year. And with that said, I turn it back over to Rob."

                "text": "Thanks, David. As we turn to Slide 11, it's important to communicate the fact that our critical digital infrastructure is more necessary now than ever before because of the world's growing need and dependency on vital applications. While we remain cautiously optimistic on the balance of the year, the dynamic nature of the situation makes it extremely difficult to provide guidance at this time. We do feel good about the demand side, and we believe the volatility of this supply chain will moderate over time, but it's not possible at this time to be able to peg a number for 2020. What I can share, however, is internally, we have run multiple scenarios, as discussed earlier, and sensitivity analysis. And even in the most aggressive downside case, with sales at $4 billion, we would still be in a position to deliver approximately $500 million in adjusted EBITDA. Clearly, additional cost actions would be taken, which we have, but those actions have been identified and are realistic from a timing and savings standpoint. I provide these numbers as a reference point, but have no reason at this time to believe we will see sales fall this far. We are always preparing for every ever-changing scenario. Now turning to Slide 12 and in closing. I want to thank you for your support over the past quarter and in the quarters to come. We participate in a great industry, as Dave said. We have the leadership and position and never has critical digital infrastructure to support the vital applications of the world been so important as it is now. Our order rate, our cost actions we've implemented, our liquidity position are all in great shape as we continue operating during this dynamic time. We will continue to invest, as Dave said, for the future while managing for today. This strategic approach will prepare us to be even more successful when we emerge from this pandemic and the world adapts to a new normal. Thank you again for your support. Stay healthy. I now turn the call over to the operator who will open the lineup for questions."

So the $60 million that you guys are targeting, it seems to me that these are kind of all incremental actions relative to the medium-term margin expansion plan that you've laid out. So maybe you could talk about the temporary versus structural nature of the cost savings. It seems to me like these are all temporary, and they will come back when demand resumes. And maybe the ability to pull some of the medium-term cost items that you guys are working through into 2020 as demand is weak."

These are costs, and we'll realize, as I mentioned in my comments, we'll benefit from the actions. Whether they're furloughs, whether they're merit increases, whether it's the discretionary expense decrease. So we fully expect to realize these costs and see them hit the bottom line throughout the quarter. We have - and you are correct, we continue to operate on what we've talked about in the past. The other levers for margin expansion, utilizing the Vertiv operating system as a utilization to increase and better our margin profile and all of the other fixed cost kind of things. Everything we've talked about, that's separate to the $60 million. This was really in addition. And as Dave Fallon mentioned, there are additional levers that we can pull if necessary, if we see demand or changes in the environment. David, do you have any other thoughts?"

I mean once volume comes back, yes, people will expect merit increases, we'll return the 401(k), that sort of thing. But as Rob points out, these are very real cost savings this year. So we will get those. And some of those costs only come back if the volume really comes back. And independent of that, I guess, somewhat complementary to it, to Rob's point, we're still working all our plans to keep fixed costs constant as we go forward. So I put all that together and say, this is a smart thing for us to be doing right now and helps us to achieve everything that we've talked about. But at the same time, we want to be prepared for the future. And as volume comes back, which we suspect it's going to, given everything we see in our industry, and we think it's actually going to be pretty darn good, yes, some of that may come back, but it's only going to come back with volume that's in that 45% contribution margin range."

Is that something that you're willing to give some color on?"

And again, as we mentioned, we're battling every day all around the world to make sure we can supply, keep our factories open, sub-suppliers. So I would just say that we expect orders to continue to be favorable, and we expect to have some COVID impact as we go through Q2, like most other companies have suggested."

We do expect, and this has been consistent with what we've talked about since the beginning, that the second half would be an upside for us. Now again, given COVID, no one can predict how long the thing will last and when every country will be back to work.

As we had been talking about, and I think in our last conference call, we talked about the fact that there was this digestion going on in the U.S. and we would expect in Q1 to begin to see orders pick up, specifically in the colo and hyperscale space. We saw real strength in the colo, hyperscale and telecommunications. And so that drove a lot of that, and that was what we had expected and it had happened. I think there were some orders. People had placed orders in advance to get in line because they want to make sure they're going to get their product. The areas which you would expect, small to medium business and enterprise during these times and the channel type business would be - would not be on a growth trajectory right now. But again, with the products we're releasing, with our focus on that market, we fully expect when people get back to work, that we'll have recovery there."

And then just lastly, a follow-up on the questions related to cost and SG&A dollars were a fair amount less than what I had been anticipating, and how they talked about some of those incremental savings still to come. So maybe just help us understand how to think about SG&A dollars in 2Q and throughout the year? And do those trend lower than the levels that were reported in the first quarter? Or again, some of the temporary actions that I realize will be achieved - do some of those temporary costs start to come back in, and so OpEx dollars start to go back up compared to where we came in at for the first quarter."

I don't - can't predict actually even what it's going to look like. But I think we've learned to do work in a different way, which could affect some of our discretionary expenses, whether it's travel, the T&E side of things. So I would fully expect that - and our team is working on new ways of doing work that are more efficient and more effective. And to give you an example, during this time, training for our sales - for our service people, traditionally is something when we fly them in, they sit in class, and it's expensive. We've been able to do and use tools online, online testing, online classes. So we'll continue to take the efficiencies and the things we've learned during this pandemic and apply those to drive more efficiency going forward. David Fallon?"

So a good portion of the cost actions that we put in place will benefit SG&A going forward. And I think some of the drivers of the lower year-over-year SG&A in 1Q versus the first quarter last year will continue going forward. We were able to put in place some restructuring activity last year, which we will benefit from in each quarter going forward. So we certainly have some tailwinds behind us as it relates to SG&A. But also reminding folks that we are continuing to invest in innovation and technology and specifically R&D, even though some of the top line issues. And that R&D will be rolling through SG&A. So even though if you look year-over-year, we do not anticipate a significant increase in SG&A because we believe we can offset some of the higher cost of R&D with some of these favorable SG&A trends. We wouldn't necessarily expect significant reductions going forward."

So what we have seen, as you mentioned, and you're direct on is that the access to the site are people actually pushing it out just because they're shut down, and we can't access that site. So the combination of not being able to manufacture the goods because of the things that are happening in our manufacturing facilities and the access to sites really drove that revenue, that $80 million COVID impact."

Obviously, nobody knows when the lockdown ends. But once the lockdown does end, how quickly would you think, all else equal, we expect to see that deferred revenue return?

So I would expect to see, as we've talked about, and again, even pre-COVID that the second half will have a nice jump into it. And I think based on what we've seen in the backlog and customer overall demand, we're not seeing people cancel or delay. Now I did mention, and we did talk about the channel, things with small to medium business, who knows how these are going to come back. And various verticals, whether it's entertainment or whether it's travel. Some of those have been impacted pretty hard. And I just can't predict how that's going to come back, but we do see other areas like health care. And the thing I'm so excited about is this work-from-home initiative is really driving the fact that we need more edge devices. Latency has become a real huge issue. I bet every one of you experienced that in your home. So overall, we see the world coming back and our stuff being more - even more vital than what it was prior to COVID."

And in general, our contribution margins in APAC are lower than the other two regions. For the sake of modeling, going forward, we would anticipate any lost sales impact, whether it's related to COVID or otherwise, to be somewhere between the 40% and 45%.

                "text": "Scott, this is David Fallon. Absolutely. So if you look at the large components of the $60 million, probably 1/3 of that is discretionary spending. And that is more than likely the bucket of costs that we would be targeting going forward to be a permanent reduction. So a portion of that is D&E as an example. And we're all kind of learning new ways to do business without jumping on a plane. And so if you look at the different components, I would say there's going to be something of that $60 million that certainly flows through into next year and going forward. And we look at - one thing - one philosophy that David Cote has brought to us is a fixed cost is a fixed cost, whether it's in the factories or in the office. And we treat all fixed costs the same, and certainly, a significant portion of this will be benefiting the factories as well."

Inventories, the - was it the shutdown in the middle of March that kind of caught you guys with your pants down, if you will, on inventories because that was a pretty meaningful build up that we saw? And presumably, you saw issues, I would imagine, in China, particularly earlier in the quarter that - and so I was a little surprised the inventory is built that much."

So absolutely, the negative impact from COVID, and we - as we got through the first quarter, we were actually in line with our internal projections as it relates to the top line. And things moved south really quickly in China, virtually shut down all of February. And then, of course, the impact in the other regions accelerated into March. So as we were putting our inventory build plans together as of early February, we didn't necessarily anticipate the size of the negative impact that actually occurred. So I would attribute a very large portion of that $40 million, if not all, just related to our sales planning projections based on where we were sitting at the end of January."

Yes, the services, one of the areas of growth is if you look at and recall when we kind of on the road and going through is services and the channel IT. So service has been a real focus for us to expand that, get higher capture rates and so forth. So we expected to see growth there. Where we were able to get access, we do have about 55%, 60% of our services are under contract and whether the preventive maintenance and so on. And we've seen some pushback on preventive maintenance and people going to more critical services necessary during this time or what we call start-up services. So we did see an uptick in the actual services, but we did see a downtick a little bit in the spare parts side of things. So the combination of the 2 kind of led us to a little bit of growth there. We expect coming out of this, especially, Dave mentioned, things are so vital now, customers really want to make sure they get their health checks on their systems and so on. So I would expect and we'll continue to invest in service people, service personnel to make sure that these networks remain vital and robust."

And given that the down 25% isn't your - clearly isn't your base case scenario, but in that scenario, are you assuming that working capital can deliver at the same rate of sales, so that 20% remains fairly constant on sales by year-end? And then I think you called out, David, that the 2Q free cash flow could be negative. Is that normal seasonality for free cash flow?"

                "text": "Yes. Just to address the second one. Absolutely. If you look at the cadence of our quarterly free cash flow, our first quarter historically has been negative. And our second quarter toggles between slightly positive or slightly negative. Certainly, free cash flow in Q2 will be impacted by the lower sales in Q1. So we are anticipating a slight use of cash in Q2 this year. And as it relates to the recovery of working capital, the way we are modeling and actuals hold true to this if we look at our historical movement in working capital. But we're assuming a 22.5% recovery in working capital per dollar of sales, whether that goes up or down. And if you compare that to the 42.5% or so contribution margin on sales, for every dollar of sales loss, we lose about $0.20 of free cash flow. And that $0.20 is 42.5% contribution margin less than - or less the 22.5% for working capital."

We're taking the appropriate actions on cost, and we have additional levers, if necessary, if this pandemic gets worse. We're continuing to drive the long-term margin expansion that we've talked about, and we'll continue to pull those 4 or 5 levers. And I want everyone to be clear, as we've mentioned many times, we feel we have solid liquidity. I want to thank all 19,000-plus employees around the world for working hard every day to take care of our customers. We appreciate all your time. Please stay safe.
