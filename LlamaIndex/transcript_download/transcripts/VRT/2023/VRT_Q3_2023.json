                "text": "Great, thank you, Brica. Good morning, and welcome to Vertiv's fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Vertiv's Executive Chairman, Dave Cote; Chief Executive Officer, Giordano Albertazzi; and Chief Financial Officer, David Fallon. Before we begin, I'd like to point out that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events including the future financial and operating performance of Vertiv. These forward-looking statements are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the cautionary language included in today's earnings release, and you can learn more about these risks in our annual and quarterly reports and other filings made with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will also present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our GAAP results and our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release and in the investor slide deck found on our website at investors.vertiv.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Executive Chairman, Dave Cote."

                "text": "Well, 2023 was a great year for Vertiv and our share owners, we created tremendous value. Our stock price increased 252% in 2023, putting us well ahead of the number one performer in all of the S&P 500 and its up very well again so far this year. We announced the capital allocation strategy at our November Investor Conference and is very flexible and we believe is structured well to provide additional benefits to share owners and is a great reflection of the cash generating capability of the company. A very nice and exceptionally promising change from where we were.  We finished the year strong, quite strong in fact, and we fully expect this to set us up well to continue to provide good returns for our share owners in 2024 and beyond. So Gio and team are off to a very good start, but we still have work to do. You'll hear Gio talk about his focus areas for 2024 and what we plan to accomplish this year to deliver another good year for our investors. It's getting the important things like customer relationships, technology, VOS, organization, resiliency, working capital and capital deployment. We demonstrated our potential in 2023, but we still have a long way to run and that's all upside. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Gio."

                "text": "Well, thank you, Dave. Thanks a lot. As Dave mentioned our stock was up 252% last year. And as Dave said, if we were in the S&P 500, we would have been the top performing stock. We believe we meet the criteria and we believe Vertiv is a good candidate for S&P 500 inclusion. Let's go to Slide 3. We finished the year strong. Operational execution continues to improve. Q4 sales were up 12% organically. Growth continues to be led by the Americas. Orders grew 23% year-on-year and 18% sequentially, good across all regions. Additionally, book-to-bill was very strong at 1.3x, a demonstration of market strength that gives us confidence in what we believe will be a strong demand environment for \u201924 and beyond. Adjusted operating profit of $330 million and adjusted operating margin of 17.7%, really a step function improvement and a demonstration of our sharpened operational execution. Our adjusted free cash flow was $305 million for a full year at $778 million resulting in more than $ 1 billion improvement year-on-year. Our net leverage at the end of the year was 1.9x. So within our target range of 1x to 2x.  And we were upgraded by both Moody's and S&P in December. In December, we announced the acquisition of CoolTera that further strengthens our technology leadership in high density and liquid cooling. More to come on that in a few slides. I'm pleased with a strong foundation. As we enter 2024, coupled with strong market demand, we feel good about our trajectory for the year and beyond. And let's move to Slide 4. We take a look at the market environment here and it's pretty consistent with what we have been seeing for a while. Cloud/Hyperscale continues to lead the growth with tangible signs of AI deployment and very strong build plans. We continue to see encouraging signs in Enterprise with customers starting to develop AI plans for their business. Be it either on-prem or cloud, either way, it's good for Vertiv. Telecom, not a lot of news here, CapEx is tight and mainly focused on retrofit.  From a regional standpoint, APAC remains soft but continues to be a story of China and the rest of Asia. The China market continues to be weak but we saw some small positive signs in terms of orders. We don't think the market is getting weaker but recovery is slow paced, if at all. In the rest of Asia, including India, we see significant investments happening across the market. Cloud & Colocation are certainly leading the pack but Enterprise customers are also investing.  We moved Commercial & Industrial to green in APAC, really driven by India. The investment and infrastructure are accelerating. The India market is quite exciting and we are well positioned. Overall, our pipeline formation is good and particularly strong in the Colo Hyperscale segment. Let's go to the next slide, Slide 5. I am pleased with the order strength we saw in Q4, 23% year-to-year and 18% sequentially. We enter \u201924 influenced by a strong 2H23 booking driven by large projects reflecting also demand from AI. We continue to post record backlog which was up about $0.5 billion from the end of Q3. Good visibility for \u201924 and beyond. We expect Q1 \u201924 orders to continue to be strong, up in the high teens on a year-on-year basis in the first quarter across the portfolio. We anticipate they will be down sequentially from Q4 but this is just a normal business pattern. We are working in close collaboration with our customers and suppliers to make sure we have the capacity in place to support the likely strong demand environment for the foreseeable future. We inaugurated a new thermal management plant in India. We have significant capacity expansion underway for switchgear and busbars across the thermal portfolio, including of course liquid cooling. As I mentioned at Investor Day, on a weekly basis, we look at evolving demand scenarios in a disciplined, rigorous, and focused way to make timely investment decisions. The backlog for AI orders continues to grow robustly. The acceleration of the overall order book related to AI, and it's never an exact science as I explained, matches the expected growth rate for the application, i.e. a growth uplift of 3% to 4% to the overall market, as we mentioned in November. I continue to caution what is and what is not AI is fungible to a certain extent. What matters is that we believe that traction is consistent with the market uplift from AI, or perhaps a bit ahead, given our strong position in thermal, and thermal is a clear differentiator.  Continuing to the right side of Slide 5, we believe that supply chains have largely returned to normal, but I'd say normal in a post-pandemic world. We are focused on making sure that resiliency is constantly increasing across the supply chain to weather what a quite complicated world can throw at us, so a lot of focus here. Looking at material inflation, we expect materials pricing to be relatively stable year-on-year, but we are very mindful that things can change rapidly. And with that, over to you, David."

                "text": "Thanks, Gio. Turning to Page 6, this slide summarizes our fourth quarter financial results. We finished the year quite strong, or our organic net sales increased 12%, 5% from volume, 7% from price, and America continues to be the growth engine which America's was up 22% in the quarter. Our sales performance was within guidance range, but slightly below midpoint, which was mainly attributable to a weaker China and some project delays in EMEA.  Adjusted operating profit was $330 million, up $120 million from last year's fourth quarter, and that was mainly driven by favorable price cost and the higher volume. We beat the midpoint of our implied fourth quarter adjusted operating profit guidance based upon good commercial execution and material inflation below our modeled assumptions. Our adjusted operating margin was 17.7% in the quarter, a 500 basis point improvement compared to last year, and that certainly was driven by our continued relentless focus on operational execution, and that clearly showed in the results. As we move to the right, our fourth quarter GAAP diluted EPS includes a $115 million non-recurring tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance, and we have removed that from adjusted diluted EPS. And we provide additional detail on that valuation allowance release on Page 28 in the Appendix, but otherwise, the year-over-year increase in adjusted diluted EPS was driven by higher adjusted operating profit. To the far right, another very strong quarter for adjusted free cash flow, as we generated $305 million in the quarter, more than doubling last year. Certainly higher profitability contributed to this result, but working capital is also an important part of the story with plenty of opportunity for continued improvement.  As Gio mentioned, that leverage declined to 1.9x within our target long-term leverage range of 1x to 2x and down from 5.6x at the end of 2022. This leverage level supports the capital deployment framework provided at our Investor Conference and gives us significant flexibility and optionality to deploy excess cash. Turning to Page 7, this slide summarizes our fourth quarter segment results. The Americas region, as I mentioned, continues to fuel the growth engine with organic net sales up 22% in the quarter. The improvement in adjusted operating margin in the Americas continues, up 640 basis points from last year to 26.9% with the increase primarily driven by favorable price cost and fixed cost leverage.  APAC sales increased 3% organically, but continues to be weighed down by China where sales were relatively flat year-over-year, but below expectations included in our quarterly guidance. APAC adjusted operating margin declined 220 points with unfavorable mix and the timing of fixed cost contributory factors.  EMEA grew 1% organically in the fourth quarter, which was lower than anticipated, primarily due to delays on several larger projects. However, we did see an 18% sequential sales increase from the third quarter, which is encouraging. And EMEA experienced strong year-over-year fourth quarter orders growth, both which provides confidence for us to project low double digit organic growth in EMEA for full year 2024.  EMEA delivered strong adjusted operating margin of 28.3% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 750 basis points from last year's fourth quarter, although they did benefit from a $6 million non-recurring gain from an asset sale in the quarter. And as Anand Sanghi, our America's President has emphatically reminded us, without that gain the adjusted operating margin for the Americas and EMEA would have been approximately the same as those two regions continue to push each other for highest regional adjusted operating margin. Next, turning to Page 8, a summary of full year 2023. I can safely say it was a very strong year. It's always a good thing when the orange bars on this slide are significantly higher than the gray bars, and that is the case for all financial metrics for this past year. 2023 produced a step function change in financial performance from 2022 that is not often seen in a 12-month period. This significant improvement is a result of a relentless focus on operational execution, which very clearly reads directly through to our financial results. Our full year organic sales up 21%, reflects a great position in a strong end market. Adjusted operating margin of 15.3%, an improvement of 760 basis points from last year, certainly provides a strong foundation to surpass our midterm adjusted operating margin target at 16%, which we expect to do in 2024 with about 110 basis points to spare at the midpoint.  We did well in converting the improved profitability to cash with an over $1 billion improvement year-over-year. And let me repeat that, an over $1 billion improvement in adjusted free cash flow year-over-year with this improvement driven by the higher profitability and improved working capital management while continuing to invest in CapEx to support growth. Adjusted free cash flow of $778 million drove an adjusted free cash flow conversion of 114%, with this improved conversion benefiting from a significant increase in deferred revenue, primarily from advanced customer payments, which increased $280 million or 80% in the year while sales were up 21%, which we estimate contributed about 30 percentage points to that conversion.  While we expect continued growth in deferred revenue, there are many market dynamics at play and we should not expect similar growth in 2024, which is one of the primary reasons we are guiding to adjusted free cash flow conversion in the low to mid 90s for full year 2024. We have much work to do and there's plenty of opportunity for continued improvement, but 2023 certainly demonstrates our potential and helps build credibility and confidence that we can execute upon our long-term strategy and deliver the financial targets we introduced at our Investor Conference. Pivoting to 2024 and moving to Slide 9, this is a look at our first quarter guidance. We are expecting first quarter sales to be up approximately 5% organically with Americas up high-single digits, APAC up mid-single digits, and EMEA relatively flat. Adjusted operating profit between $200 million and $220 million and adjusted operating margin of 13.1% up 160 basis points from last year's first quarter and that is driven by price cost tailwinds and productivity programs partially offset by continued growth investments. As you likely have noted in our slide deck, we have not provided the detailed split between price and cost/inflation for 2024. As we emphasized at our Investor Conference, our ambition is to cover all inflation including labor inflation with price and being price cost positive is an important lever for us to attain our long-term adjusted operating margin target of 20% plus.  As you will see on the next slide, we fully expect to be price cost positive in 2024 and we expect that to be the case each year going forward. We will continue to price our products commensurate with the increasing value we provide our customers. However, for commercial and competitive reasons, we are not disclosing the specific quantified pricing figure going forward. But rest assured, that commercial excellence actions are core tenant to our continued profit improvement program and we believe we are well positioned in a favorable market to continue to execute upon our long-term plans. Next, turning to Slide 10, our full year guidance. Higher across all metrics from the view presented at our November Investor Conference. Organic net sales growth is expected to be 9% to 11%, up from the 8% to 10% we shared in November. We are increasing the midpoint for adjusted operating profit from $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion with adjusted operating margin at 17.1%, well above the previously established mid-term target of 16%. And as a reminder, our long-term margin target is 20% plus and we believe we will take all the necessary next steps in \u201924 on our path toward that target. Our projected 2024 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.23 at the midpoint is approximately 25% higher than 2023 primarily driven by higher adjusted operating profit and partially offset by taxes and a higher share count as a higher share price drives more accounting dilution for employee stock options. We have included some estimates for share repurchases and share price in our estimated \u201924 diluted share count but we are not prepared at this point to share specifics for either. But we believe the 393 million shares estimate for full year diluted share count is a reasonable and balanced guidance but certainly subject to change based upon several variables. Moving to the right, on this Slide, we are projecting adjusted free cash flow between $800 million and $850 million representing 94% adjusted free cash flow conversion at the midpoint. As mentioned, this is lower than 2023 conversion primarily due to assumptions with deferred revenue and higher investment in CapEx.  And finally, as we introduced at our Investor Conference, there will be a couple of external reporting changes in 2024 to align with how we run the business. We summarize these changes on Slide 31 in the Appendix and we have provided a historical recasting for these changes going back to 2020 in Exhibit 99.2 of our earnings release. And with that said, I turn it back over to Gio."

                "text": "Well, thank you. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot, David. And we go to Slide 11. Thank you. You saw this slide at our Investor Conference. We are the market leader in thermal management for data centers. We have the most complete portfolio of thermal management solutions including liquid cooling to lead the industry as a transition to GPU accelerate. We can do this customizing at scale and we believe we have a very strong position. This slide here shows also our high-density liquid cooling portfolio. In November, the technology was both owned and partnership based. Now it's fully owned.  We can go to Slide 12. On the 8th of December, we closed the acquisition of CoolTera, which has industry leading liquid cooling technology. We have now secured that technology with full ownership. We have been close partners of CoolTera for years. Now, take CoolTera's premier technology, certified and approved by key chip manufacturers along with established customer relationships, combine that with Vertiv's reach and you can scale the technology at a pace that will support our customers' aggressive AI deployment plans.  We have already started to manufacture CoolTera CDUs in one of the Vertiv plants and we expect to have capacity quadrupled by the end of Q1. We are executing on a plan to scale the production of our liquid cooling solutions more than 40 times by the end of this year. We truly want to make sure that we have capacity to cover the most aggressive GPU growth scenarios. That is what Vertiv means by scaling technology, activating our global manufacturing and supply chain footprint. Let's go now to Slide 13. This is where we obsessively focus to deliver another very good year. It starts with the customers. We plan to continue leveraging our far-reaching and deep customer relationships and have the technology, the portfolio, the innovation and the capacity to meet their demand. We spoke about the capacity expansion underway. We have allocated additional investments to CapEx to support our customers.  Our global scale matters and will continue to differentiate us. Vertiv Operating System is foundational across the organization helping us to realize productivity, improvements in general and giving us speed. We have started to make progress on trade working capital but there is more work to do. We are not optimized. It continues to have my full attention and we are improving. Our capital deployment framework provides much flexibility driven by good cash flow generation. So a lot to do in 2024 and be sure work is fully underway to continue to execute well on all these focus areas.  Now to Slide 14. We started 2024 in strong positions. Orders in Q1, backlog at the end of the year were very strong. Orders in Q4, backlog at the end of the year were very strong. End markets continue to signal strong and increasing demand for the foreseeable future, certainly driven by AI. We expect to have the capacity to support our customers, that is our commitment to them.  Investments in capacity and R&D to support the growth of the business will continue. Our foundation is stronger today than ever before. Our focus area will continue to strengthen that foundation and increase the resiliency of the organization to navigate, again, an increasingly complicated world. VOS, Vertiv Operating System is a cornerstone for that, a robust, resilient operating system deployed globally.  I am pleased with the progress but I see even more opportunity than I did when I stepped into the CEO role, much more. There is work to do and we look forward to updating you on our progress and we look forward to our questions now.  So over to the operator, and thank you very much."

And I know you're not going to talk about it for competitive reasons, but you have disclosed pricing for 2023. So if we sort of plug in any sort of reasonable pricing for \u201924, right, on a net basis, I know the $60 million looks fairly conservative, particularly given what you\u2019ve achieved, even in the fourth quarter, if you could address that.

It's something that continues to be simple. Just by the same token, I've been vocal about the fact that while we continue to believe that we operate in a price favorable environment, but the marginal price gains will diminish for obvious reasons and a different inflationary environment we're in. But we operate the biggest part of our business operates in favor from a demand supply balance environment. So we continue to count on price. Now, the pace of that price will, again, the price gains diminish, but we're confident we'll continue to be positive. And I don't know, if you want to add something, David?"

So I'm thinking about the organic sales growth guide for 2024, which certainly terrific in an absolute sense is obviously a lot lower than what you achieved in 2023. So I'm wondering to what extent does the guidance for \u201924 reflect potential bottlenecks, both from the standpoint of perhaps your customer's ability to source permitting and utility power on the one hand and then also, of course, your own supply chain with respect to fans and IGBTs and breakers and so forth?

We have dynamics in the sense that certainly our second half orders \u201923 were strong and good. And that reflects in the way, the shape of our backlog in general. We do not see a supply chain bottleneck, our end. It's never infinite, but the constraining factor, if you will, if we can call it so, is the fact that simply there's large projects and with large projects we're talking have relatively long requested lead times from our customers. So it's a natural cycle. We were vocal in the past and we continue to be vocal that the whole industry needs to confront itself with power availability, permitting, etc. But I would say that in the in the twelve, eighteen months, is really the natural pace of build outs and sites, etc. So we pretty much deliver on what our customers request right now.

So if I'm doing the math right, it looks like $2.4 billion of orders in the quarter, up from $1.9 billion in the third quarter. I'm guessing you're going to say America's hyperscale sector, but maybe just give us some context on what drove that sequential acceleration. But more importantly, can you maybe talk about the funnel, whatever you want to call it, of opportunities you see coming up in the next quarter or two? And then, David, just maybe just stress this very specifically. You said the third revenues will continue to grow in \u201924. Does that indicate that backlog continues to expand from here?"

What we have positively noticed is an increased velocity in the pipeline. So we believe that's a characteristic trait of the pipeline that will stay with us. So that is true, the funnel continues to grow. And that's true pretty much globally, certainly for the Americas, EMEA and in many parts of Asia. So we're positive. We're positive about that.

Gio, I was hoping to talk about -- I think you talked about AI activity broadly in line, if not slightly better than you had expected. That's the way you described it. Can you just talk about and I realize you said it's not easy for you to be precise, but how much of your orders or your backlog you think are AI driven today? And as you engage with these cloud customers, do you see them sort of preferring more the route of direct-to-chip or full immersion? Just sort of looking at what your customers are looking to build a data center technology with, as they go forward?"

                "text": "Thank you, and a good day to you. As I explained on a couple of occasions, it's very, very hard for us and I think for everyone, truly to be exact. It's not an exact science as said in where we're going through the slides. It\u2019s not exact science deciding what goes to or being sure of what goes to AI applications or not. As I said, there are some pro-lines that are univocally destined to high density GPU AI like any sort of high density cooling or liquid cooling, some elements of in Rack Power Distribution. But at a certain stage, we want to make sure that we don't go to the side of too much details and too much details also from a competitive standpoint.  But we are very happy about the trajectory of the backlog and the trajectory of the pipeline. But the vast majority of our portfolio is really fungible, as I said, in the sense that also a lot of what you see built today and designed today is not univocally one or the other. It is data centers that need to be hybrid in their very nature because they will host both traditional, let's say, CPU and GPU with configurations that may and will actually change over time. So the mix of loads in the same data center changes. The challenge here for all in the industry, and that's why we cooperate very, very strongly with hyperscalers and the largest colos, is how do you design it in a way that you can transition that way? How can you build that intrinsic flexibility there? So that's why it's very difficult for me to answer in a credible way to your question. And I would invite the entire industry to be less [blankly] black and white on this because I don't think you can. Having said that, we're very happy about the trajectory, we're very happy about the trajectory of what is univocally destined to AI, but also the pull-through of what we know, believe, see is AI-driven, medium, long-term in our pipeline. Direct or immersion? Direct, that's what we hear in spades, that's the discussions that we have predominantly with all. Does it mean there is no room for immersion? No, but we just see more direct than anything else. But again, the fun part of the -- a lot of the -- a very interesting part of our job today is that we really figure out and design with the big players across the world what the future looks like and that is a highly cooperative activity. That was a bit long answer, sorry about that, but hopefully."

And obviously, you're increasing capacity off a very, very low base. But if we go back to the Investor Day, you said you had $100 million of really direct AI revenue exposure, and there was another $250 million, which was kind of in that fungible category that was maybe AI, but you didn't know for sure. I don't think you're telling us here that $100 million is going to $4.5 billion, multiplying it by 100 by 45. But what are you telling us here? It's obviously a pretty dramatic chart. "

That means that we, indeed, start from a relatively low base. When we were talking about $100 million at Investor Day, of course, that doesn't mean its all liquid cooling, by the way. We were talking about a backlog that was spread over months and quarters, so it's not necessarily a peak point realized at the beginning of the year. The fact is, we start from a low base. We believe that we'll be able to bring the capacity that the industry needs and plus, and that's done activating three Vertiv plants across all continents and with a rapidity and with a broad reach of our supply chain. So the message is, without going in exactly in the numbers for obvious reasons, but the message is we will have capacity, and we have capacity.

We certainly will have a challenging comparison in Q1, so do not expect necessarily this acceleration that we shared with you to happen necessarily in Q1.

But just more broadly on capacity, it seems to me that adding second shifts would be a big meaningful increase in your capacity capability.

When I say adding more shifts in general, adding more capacity, utilization of the asset, so think about our capacity increase as exactly a combination of more, net-net more square feet, square meters, more utilization, investment going up. And you have seen our CapEx projections go up year-on-year. And there is a utilize -- at VOS, Vertical Operating System productivity, certainly plays a big role. And there is an ability to utilize more the capacity that at any given instant we have available. And this is not different from what we shared already in October and indeed at Investor Day.

Well, we've delivered another strong quarter, built squarely on getting the fundamentals right, good operational execution throughout the organization that translated nicely, outperforming guidance in the third quarter. I believe we're starting to see a trend and one we plan to continue. Financial and operating performance continues to strengthen significantly across the board. And the most exciting part of that is we're still early in our path of improvement. Alignment to great end market matters. We have a great position in a good industry, and our technology differentiation continues to strengthen. Data continues to proliferate in good times and bad times. And that portends a very favorable end market environment for the foreseeable future. We're intending to finish the year strong. The benefits of our seed planning are taking hold and still to be fully realized. Our end markets remain resilient. Operational execution continues to improve, and there is still a lot of runway ahead. That is a great setup as we think about 2024 and beyond. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Gio."

                "text": "Well, thank you, Dave. In the last 12 months, we have created intense focus on operational execution, including margin improvement and cash flow generation, combined with a sense of urgency, which underpins a high-performance culture. This quarter shows progress across the board, exceeding our own expectations, demonstrating there is still more value the business can deliver. Here are some highlights. Third quarter sales were up 17% organically. Americas continues to lead the growth, up 40%. We continue to see headwinds in APAC, specifically in China. More on that in a few slides. Very pleased with our orders, up 11%, excluding FX. We were not totally surprised by the strength in orders. We have seen pipelines built, but timing is never certain. We are encouraged by the order booking acceleration. We believe this is a sign of good things to come. Adjusted operating profit that was $296 million, and adjusted operating margin of 17%. Operational execution is sharpening and certainly translating into margin performance. We had another strong cash flow quarter, an area of intense focus, and we are delivering. Of course, this has a nice effect on our leverage, which was 2.4 at the end of September, and guidance gets us close to 2x by year-end. Given our performance year-to-date, we are raising our full year guidance. Again, we're now expecting sales for the full year to be up 21% organically, AOP between $1,020 million and $1,030 million and adjusted free cash flow of $625 million at the midpoint. A very strong year continues to unfold, and we see that momentum enduring. Let's turn to Slide 4. No changes on the market environment slide. Things are consistent with the picture we gave 90 days ago, healthy markets overall. The data center end market remains strong, with the cloud hyperscale and colocation continued to lead the growth. We see accelerating demand and a strong overall market for the foreseeable future. Different customers are at different points in their demand cycle, but they all recognize that strong future demand is coming. There are encouraging signs from enterprise. We are hearing a more positive outlook, but still balanced against some macro concerns. Telecom is still weak. Some telco carriers have delayed investments, and there is a lull in the market after a few years of a strong 5G investment. Regionally, APAC remains soft, mainly due to a slow Chinese market, partially offset by encouraging signs in India and rest of Asia. We don't anticipate a sharp recovery in China and expect that it will stay soft until the back end of 2024. Now the bright spot in APAC, India, is quite convincing. A lot of investment happening, and the trend is likely to continue for quite a while. We are also seeing good activity in Malaysia, the Philippines and Southeast Asia in general. I continue to be quite encouraged by the market signals. We are seeing the demand formation in the pipeline, in the order book, in conversations with customers all over the world. There's a very good seg to Slide 5. Let's go to Slide 5, please. Orders in Q3 were up 11% year-on-year and 16% sequentially. I have said throughout the year that pipeline activity is strong. We are seeing that translate into orders. So not entirely surprising, but encouraging velocity. We anticipate Q4 orders will also be positive year-on-year. I wouldn't be surprised if Q4 growth was like Q3's, velocity is increasing. Now we get a lot of questions on the amount of AI activity in our order book. Those questions are often formulated as binary questions. Is it AI? Or is it not AI? But there is no binary answer. If we talk about technologies that univocally are applied to high-density GPU or compute, as for example, liquid cooling, CDUs or some rack-level power distribution solutions. I will still say our order book is in the tens of millions of dollars. But many elements of our portfolio, chillers, direct expansion cooling, heat rejection systems, switchgear, busbars, UPS, you name them are used - regardless if GPU or CPU compute, high density or normal density. So, the volume supporting AI or future AI-proof data centers is way larger than that tens of millions. Also, many data centers have been designed to be multipurpose. So, the majority of our products will support many types of compute, including AI. That is the beauty of having a comprehensive portfolio of all critical infrastructure technologies, across the entire span of the powertrain, the thermal chain and IT-wide space infrastructure, something that very few companies truly have. Different players, hyperscale, colocation, but also enterprise and edge will have different approaches to AI. And now that suits us well. Complexity, customization at scale, all things we're good at. So overall, AI is coming, and we anticipate it will show up. We're in a more pronounced manner in 2024. Now on to supply chain. We are in a much different place than we were historically, much different. I'm not just talking about incrementally better than 90 days ago. If you look at the progress over the last year, you tangibly see this in our reduced lead times. Suppliers of key components have been making substantial capacity investments, and we are seeing the benefit. We have qualified many additional suppliers, with a sharp eye on geopolitical diversification and overall supply chain resilience. We are doing capacity locks in key areas to make sure the supply base is strong for today and for the future under various growth scenarios. We will be ready. Let's move to Slide 6. Here, we want to provide some additional color around capacity, an important topic given the different growth scenarios that are indeed possible. We start in a strong place, with 22 manufacturing plants around the world. It's much more believable to say you can scale with this strong starting point. The existing footprint was built with the idea that future growth would need to be accommodated. So you've seen us scale, expand existing facilities, ramp-up the two facilities - the two new facilities to support growth. And we have buffer capacity in our plants today, roughly around additional 25% to support more intense growth periods and can flex across facilities, to optimize our production. And of course, we continue to invest. Productivity is another capacity lever. The utilization and productivity opportunities are plentiful. And candidly, just starting. Vertiv's operating system is being deployed vigorously across the organization, unlocking further capacity. I enjoyed tremendously running a plant during my early years with the company. So, there is a manufacturing in general is near and dear to my heart. It has my and there's a full attention. We'll continue to make capital investments to support growth. We will be ready for what is ahead, but this can be done in a measured way that does not significantly change the cash flow profile of this business. We can invest for growth, prudently and deliver strong free cash flow. And with that, over to you, David."

                "text": "Great. Thanks, Gio. Turning in the presentation to Page 7. This slide summarizes our third quarter financial results. As you can see, strong financial performance continues across the board. Organic net sales up 17%, with 9% from volume and 8% from pricing. As Gio mentioned, we continue to see the Americas, which was up 40% organically, drive the growth engine, particularly in this past third quarter. Adjusted operating profit was $162 million higher than last year's third quarter, mainly driven by $100 million price cost benefit and $45 million of volume. Adjusted operating profit was $40-plus million higher than our prior guidance, driven by $15 million higher-than-anticipated pricing and $30 million lower inflation, as we have seen some core metals, notably steel, trending lower in the past quarter. We did have a onetime $7 million benefit from a commercial concession, as we note on this slide that also contributed to the favorability versus prior guidance. This commercial concession also favorably influenced adjusted operating margin by 40 to 50 basis points as adjusted operating margin reached 17% in the quarter. And that's 790 basis point higher than last year, a great indicator of the significant progress we have made in a relatively short period in driving operational execution. Certainly more work to do, but third quarter results should provide some confidence in our ability to achieve our longer-term margin targets. Moving to the right on this slide. We had another strong quarter of adjusted free cash flow, generating $221 million in the quarter, a year-over-year improvement of $241 million. We continue to see the benefit of higher profitability and improved working capital management really across the organization. Cash taxes were higher, the inevitable result of driving higher profitability. But in general, we are driving much more consistency and predictability with our cash flow, controlling the things that matter, notably trade working capital, as we fully appreciate that sales and profitability mean little if they do not translate into cash flow, which is absolutely essential to drive long-term shareholder value. Last on this slide, if you look at the bottom right-hand corner, net leverage declined to 2.4 times at the end of the quarter and is expected to be approximately 2.1 times by year-end. Of course, this net leverage improvement certainly correlates with improved cash generation. Clearly, our balance sheet continues to strengthen, which provides flexibility as we think about capital deployment. And more to come on capital deployment in our November 29 Investor Conference. Next, turning to Page 8. This slide summarizes our third quarter segment results. The Americas region continues its strong growth trajectory with organic net sales up 40%, including 28% from volume and 12% from pricing. We continue to see substantial year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating margin in the Americas, up 910 basis points, which is largely driven by favorable price cost and fixed cost leverage. APAC top line, moving to the center section of the graph, continues to be negatively impacted by China, with organic net sales in that region declining 7% from last year. From a sub-region perspective, the rest of Asia, so everything outside of China continues to grow nicely year-over-year, up low double-digits in the third quarter. Adjusted operating margin for APAC remained flat year-over-year despite the lower sales at 19.1%, really a strong testament to their focus on cost control while continuing to drive margin enhancements. Now we do anticipate that APAC will return to mid- to low single-digit year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter, in part due to typical fourth quarter seasonality in China, but this region will likely be down for full year 2023 versus 2022. And we are not planning for a sharp recovery in China at the beginning of '24. Rather, we are expecting sales activity to be relatively muted, at least until the back half of next year. The EMEA region was relatively flat organically in the third quarter, which was slightly better than we anticipated in guidance. Flat year-over-year sales in the quarter was mostly due to timing, as we expect a significant sequential increase in the fourth quarter, with full year organic sales growth in that region in the upper single to low double-digits. EMEA continues to deliver strong adjusted operating margin, almost 28% this quarter, an increase of 1,030 basis points compared with last year's third quarter, with the improvement driven by favorable price/cost and good fixed cost control. And finally, on this page, corporate costs in the third quarter were approximately $7 million higher than last year, driven by both R&D investment and an incremental $3 million foreign exchange loss. Our current guidance assumes second half corporate costs in the aggregate to be consistent with the first half. Next, turning to Page 9. This slide summarizes our fourth quarter guidance. We expect a strong finish to the year with adjusted operating profit in the range of $295 million to $305 million and adjusted operating margin at 16.3% at the midpoint, 360 basis points higher than last year's fourth quarter. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be down sequentially from the 17% in the third quarter as regional mix plays a role with higher APAC volume. And recall that the third quarter was favorably impacted by the commercial concession that we talked about a couple of slides ago. Adjusted free cash flow is also projected to be lower sequentially as we expect CapEx to ramp up about $35 million, a lot of that driven by timing. And working capital use should be approximately $35 million higher in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter as sales are expected to increase about $100 million sequentially. China cash collections are a watch item for the fourth quarter, with larger customers paying a bit slower given the macro environment there and the impact on cash availability. Next, moving to Slide 10, our full year guidance. We are increasing projected full year sales by approximately $30 million and adjusted operating profit to $1.20 billion to $1.30 billion, an increase of over $580 million from 2022. This revised guidance is approximately $75 million higher than previous guidance, with $40 million from the third quarter beat and $35 million from the raise in the fourth quarter. Full year adjusted operating margin is expected to be 15%, 730 basis points higher than last year, with approximately 500 basis points from higher variable contribution margin and over 200 basis points from fixed cost leverage. And finally, on this page, we are increasing adjusted free cash flow guidance by $75 million to $625 million at the midpoint, $885 million higher than last year. This improvement demonstrates our focus on cash and the operational process improvements that, have taken a hold across the organization. And our commitment to delivering strong and consistent free cash flow is a crucial part of our high-performance culture, and I believe this could be a harbinger of continued good things to come. And with that said, I turn it back over to Gio."

                "text": "Well, thank you, David. Thanks a lot. And let's go to Slide 11. So some initial thoughts on 2024. I'm going to say we see more tailwinds than headwinds. Our starting point, is a strong. The data center market continues to accelerate. And AI is forming a tailwind that will likely be more evident in 2024. Our supply chain - resilience is at a much greater level of maturity. This is important as we think about the demand profiles that may emerge for next year and beyond. Balanced investments in the business will continue. R&D capacity, things that will support the growth of the business for the years to come. We will continue our relentless focus on operational execution and implement the Vertiv operating system increasingly deeply. This will support continuous improvement consistently. We have started making progress, but much more to come. There are headwinds too. Certainly, China is slow, and recovery doesn't appear near term. Worth noting, we anticipate more normal seasonality returning in 2024. And for Vertiv, that typically means our financial measures in absolute dollars get stronger sequentially as the year progresses. Let's go to Slide 12. Once more, remind everyone that we have our first Investor Conference on the 29th of November. So here are the topics we plan to cover that day. And we'll be sharing a lot of exciting information. I look forward to spending the day with you, talking about our strategy, technology, use on the market, operations and financial framework. We hope you will be able to join us, preferably in person, or remote. Let's go to Slide 13. I'd say we have meaningfully evolved from where we were a year ago. You can see that across all the key takeaways on this slide. A lot of improvement. It has been quite intense and fun, and we are still quite far from our full potential. I want to thank our team around the world for the passion and the hard work, tackling challenges every day, making sure we exceed our customer expectations, helping the entire industry scale and holding ourselves accountable for delivering strong results every quarter.

But do you have to start giving back some of that when you get into 2024? Is there a new paradigm just, because your -- perhaps your kind of value-based selling and kind of figure out how to hold that - how to hold the line on price a little bit more effectively than maybe in the past?"

We'll talk about the overall net increment on installed power, and the need for total cost of ownership, efficiency, et cetera. So the world is becoming more complex. Value in terms of the technology that you deliver matters. And we talked about Vertiv's ability to exercise the pricing muscle, both in terms of process and in terms of translating value in the initial price, both in terms of project price process and in general, pricing new technology. But it's also true that the industry - in the industry in general, there is more demand than capacity. So that is certainly a favorable environment in many respects. I'm going to say that we see in the future, diminishing price gains. We have certainly enjoyed a lot of the kind of catching up after the inflation. But again, we continue to be positive about the future investor respect."

As I mentioned, we are going more towards a normal is what is, historically normal first half/second half. 2023 may expect a little bit abnormal in the sense that we had a pent-up backlog, let me say, almost a 2022 backlog residue that we moved because of the shortage of components, et cetera, moved to the first half of the year. So that makes certainly a more flat H1, H2 year. In this moment, we are thinking something that probably will be around 45%, 55% top line, first half, second half. Give and take something, it's too early to say, but that's probably the thought - that thought process. I would be surprised, and it's again, early, but I would be surprised if H1 '24 were below 2023. So we - I don't think it was going to be positive all the way through.

And as we said, we have many ways to make sure that we make the capacity available. Productivity being one, we're making sure that we use everything that we have created in terms of capacity over the last couple of years. But yes, we - if the conditions, as we believe, will favor that, we think we can be a little bit more aggressive.

I guess the first one I had was, your orders accelerated really nicely, I think it was up 11% year-over-year, you sound more positive going forward on this as well. How much of this uplift do you think in orders is driven by volume versus pricing? And any sense if the duration of - orders that customers are putting in is starting to stretch out as well? And maybe that's helping also. Maybe you can talk about pricing versus volume versus duration on orders would be really helpful?"

As I'm saying, we are - as we are saying, we are - we're printing nice price numbers this year in our sales. We expect that to trim a little bit. And the growth - the future growth will have a very good volume component. When it comes to the duration, I think you're asking duration in terms of how far out the orders that, we are receiving and covering. And I would say it's a little bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, there are shortened lead times, that I mentioned in a few occasions and also earlier today, are favorable in terms of accelerating what is the so-called run rate more territory business, which is always good, great also in terms of installed base creation for future service revenue. But we see also increasingly the big part of the - big players, be them hyperscalers or be them the large colocation players increasingly look out in terms of coverage. So it's really a good combination of the two."

There's an expectation that new data center deployments will add, I don't know, 15, 20 gigawatts of incremental power consumption in the next few years. And you think about these racks going from 10 kilowatts to 50, 100. Can you talk about what does it do to your power management side of the portfolio? Do we need a completely different set of power solutions versus what we have today? What does that imply for work at this [ph] I think Edwards [ph] always focused on the cooling side, which is obviously incredibly positive. But I'd love to know how does it play out on the power management side as we shift into these higher density racks?"

Fundamentally, the powertrain that we have, from medium voltage switchgear all the way to busbars and PDUs, so the entire powertrain, it's not going to change dramatic. It's just going to be more, deployed more, because it's more power that needs to be transferred from the grid to the chip. So it's good news. It's a net volume increase. There will be some fine-tuning in what exactly happens in terms of power distribution inside the rack. Some PDU solutions will be designed for high density, but it's a relatively small portion of the total powertrain that will expand as a lot. The other aspect is positive for the power side of our business is that power is, as we said several times that the industry is very vocal about that, an overall constraint, power availability for new data centers. And that drives operators to think about alternative ways to power. So dynamic power solution, microgrids, battery, energy storage systems, et cetera, are all future opportunities that we are keenly looking into and for which we are cooperating with the big players in terms of proof of concepts, et cetera. Something - a future good opportunity for us."

I'm very encouraged by pipelines in EMEA and also the conversations with the various customers. And you do say that the macroeconomics are not phenomenal in EMEA.

But we do have a very explicit and well-orchestrated initiative, to make sure that we use and leverage the global capacity also for the U.S. It's something that we are doing already partially today in different degrees, different lines of business. But it's something that we will be able to accelerate and accentuate as we go ahead. In terms of American codes versus other type of codes, that's something that - it's just about having the right certification, of a plant outside the North American or American region.

More distributed compute, more edge compute or sometimes even on-prem or proprietary data centers. So clearly, the biggest part of the acceleration is coming, and it will come from the hyperscale, colo and cloud. But we are optimistic and positive about the Enterprise business.

We've been hearing that there have been some - and you guys sound pretty confident on this in the fourth quarter, some - not only early indications of orders for next year from hyperscalers, but like some real big orders in the last couple of weeks. And that the only real concern is like when they're going to actually want delivery, i.e., like when suppliers are going to produce. I'm just curious as to if you're kind of seeing that profile, if you're seeing those orders yet in that you're kind of caution on next year is just more about not knowing really when those things will ship, given that we're in kind of a very growthy and perhaps fluid situation, where these guys are still figuring out the best way to go about this. I'm just curious as to how tangible that demand is early in October. And I think - I don't know, it would make sense to me that you guys are talking a lot about capacity here and proving that you have the capacity, which would be juxtaposed against what I think people are viewing as a \"soft start to next year.\" I'm just trying to kind of put that all together and understand how concrete this visibility on orders is that you guys have early in the quarter here in the fourth quarter?"

And again, it would have been the same of '23 first half, were it not for the supply constraints that marred the entire 2022 for us and for everyone else. So that, if anything, there was an artificial drift of backlog from, let's say, the second half of '22 to the first half of '23, that balanced the two halves in '23 in a way that is not so kind of normal in our type of business. So, I would not read too much into it. We are happy about our pipeline. We're happy about the order pace. And yes, a lot of those orders will be coming from hyperscale and colo and that type of market. And really, those orders are placed today for tomorrow.

But it's built on the installed base that we are growing. So we are happy about the direction. We want to accelerate further, and we'll accelerate further. But definitely, a component of service that is being able and uniquely, given our global footprint and experience, uniquely able to accompany our customers in the complexity from an installation commissioning start-up standpoint or retrofit standpoint. The company [ph] or customer on the journey of high density, be it cooling high density, very complex.

We had another strong quarter of performance at Vertiv, which positions us very well to achieve our significantly increased 2023 outlook. Adjusted free cash flow, adjusted operating profit, sales and margins all performed very well and operational execution continues to improve. We've raised our full year guidance because of our strong first half performance. We also have the very pleasant effect of a strengthening balance sheet. The data center end market continues to look very healthy, and there is an incremental tailwind from AI coming. And that tailwind should provide additional opportunities over many years for Vertiv because our technology will matter. A great market position, a great industry where we can differentiate with technology, these attributes are what attracted me to Vertiv over four years ago, and they are truer today than ever. We're obviously pleased with the results, but there is so much more to come. There's a lot of upside, not just in the market and our technology, but also just continuing to fix legacy process issues and building a high performance culture which didn't exist. Gio and his team are off to a great start, and there is a lot of work left to be done, but it is also [Audio Dip] supports more consistent execution over the long-term. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Gio."

                "text": "Well, thank you very much, Dave. We saw the positive momentum continuing into second quarter across all key financial metrics. Second quarter sales were up 25% organically, led again by a 48% increase in Americas. We continue to see supply chain improvements and increased resiliency. We saw healthy market demand, which supported the shipment of substantial volume in the Americas region. Orders excluding FX were down just 3% from last year's second quarter better than anticipated, and book-to-bill remained at one. Despite ongoing order normalization as well as difficult comparison, the market remains healthy. We have also seen an encouraging AI-related activity, and I'll elaborate on this when we cover Slide 6. Our adjusted operating profit was $251 million, and we saw benefits from our increased volume as well as price cost. Our adjusted operating profit margin improved 860 basis points to 14.5% as we continue to strengthen operational execution. I am particularly pleased to report the strong adjusted free cash flow of $227 million in second quarter. We also continue to see the leverage profile of the business improve at 3.1x at the end of Q2 as the balance sheet continues to strengthen. These are early successes and still much more opportunity ahead. We are raising fairly significantly our full year guidance. And are now expecting sales for the full year to be up 20% organically, AOP at $950 million at the midpoint and adjusted free cash flow of $550 million at the midpoint. We are executing our plan to deliver the full year one quarter at a time, and our transformation continues. We are making meaningful steps forward in our operational execution. We are demonstrating clear traction and there is tremendous value creation ahead. We're not relenting our focus on operational execution, that is what we intend to continue to demonstrate each and every quarter. So let's now turn to Page 4. A few changes on the market environment slide. First, we moved cloud hyperscale to green in EMEA. Globally, we have seen an acceleration in the cloud hyperscale and colocation market segment in the last 90 days, substantiated by the large amount of incremental capacity that is being planned as well as by the amount of leasing capacity that was signed in this past quarter gigabytes of new capacity. Our pipelines have clearly strengthened. It is hard to delineate what is AI and what is not. But we know the industry is certainly getting ready for AI, and we have orders in our books and opportunities in our pipeline that are unequivocally for AI infrastructure. Conversations with cloud and colo players are now around making sure there is available capacity to support a healthy outlook, and we are in discussions with several large and relevant customers on what this commercial arrangement can look like, very encouraging. As we move to telecom, this area has further weakened in the last 90 days, with some further carving of spent by the major telco carriers. We anticipate the teleco markets remain quiet for the balance of 2023, not particularly worrisome. These patterns are not atypical for this market. We have left the APAC market yellow across the segments. The China market specifically, experienced a slower-than-expected start to the year, not just for us but for most companies. In our current view, we are not anticipating much recovery in China market in 2023, but there are some encouraging signs as we see orders turned positive in Q2 and pipelines are healthy. No changes in view on enterprise SMB or commercial and industrial. Overall, I'm more encouraged today than 90 days ago, given clear demand signals from the cloud hyperscale colocation markets that support our view for second half 2023 and shape our thinking around 2024. Let's move to Slide 5. Orders performed better than anticipated, although down 3%, they are coming together stronger than expected, and they were 13% sequentially up from Q1. Book-to-bill ratio of one preserves a healthy backlog. We anticipate orders flat more or less in Q3 and turning positive in Q4. I know everyone is interested in what AI orders looks \u2013 looked like in the quarter. And candidly, that would be almost impossible to answer with precision. We have seen AI-related orders, I would say, in the tens of millions of dollars. Our customers are focused on AI retrofit rate infrastructure, and we see evidence of this in our pipelines. Many of our products today can be used for either regular density or high density applications, and we won't be able to report out a discrete AI number. For example, most AI viewed today are still being air cooled, perfectly served by the traditional Vertiv portfolio. Over time, a part of these loads will transition to liquid. And here too, we are uniquely positioned, liquid to remove heat from the server and the rack, but removal of the heat doesn't stop outside the rack. You need to remove the heat from the data hole, and we have a portfolio of solutions to do just that. As I say, we are seeing clear demand acceleration signals from the market, and we are having conversations with very relevant market players, around securing capacity and not just over the next few quarters, but well into 2024 and beyond. Let us transition to supply chain. We see improving the environment but there are two parts to this story. First, supply chain continues to incrementally improve. No doubt, lead times are gradually reducing, and there is more certainty in supply. The second part is the self-health part. We have been vocal about our multisourcing programs. One of the most important architects of this ongoing supply chain resilience program, Paul Ryan, is now our leader of global procurement. He is not new to me or Vertiv. He has been with us over a decade and has more than 25 years of experience and a strong track record operational execution combined with very clear strategic vision. Supply chain resilience is key considering the demand waves that may be ahead. Let's now talk capacity. We have been investing in capacity for a few years in a balanced approach across the globe. [Audio Dip] the focus is on utilizing and coordinating capacity globally. We have recently announced a new role in the organization, Executive Vice President, Manufacturing, Logistics and operational excellence with Anders Karlborg leading the effort. Over the last five years, Anders led Vertiv's operations in Asia, EMEA and finally, Americas. In the Americas operations over the past year, specifically, we have seen significant improvements. He's the right person to take the organization to the next level on process and operations improvement as well as company-wide deployment of all Vertiv operating system. Our ability to navigate strong periods of growth in a complex environment continues to improve. Let's talk about inflation. While inflation is trending a bit more favorably than anticipated, a couple of dynamics influence the second half of 2023. First, metal prices were at lower levels in Q3 and Q4 over the last year. So as we lap that comparison, we're experiencing year-on-year inflation, a bitter higher \u2013 a bit higher in the second half. We also anticipate when the Chinese economy accelerates, that increased demand could cause additional inflationary pressure on commodities. We have seen a favorable tailwind from price cost with good processes in place that better prepare us for volatility related to our input costs. Let's go to Slide 6. We believe AI will increase our overall TAM. AI is a reinforcement of demand trend and AI workloads are incremental to new applications. They aren't in general, replacing other applications in our digital economy. We expect growth in both high density and general compute. This benefits all Vertiv technologies. We believe liquid cooling is not a displacement risk and in fact, is additive to growth for Vertiv. Before liquid cooling, we would take the heat from it outside the rack to outside the data center building. With liquid cooling, it's additive. We reach out into the rack and get one step closer to the heat generation point while still controlling all parts of the heat rejection. The infrastructure transition to AI, high density environment will be complicated and likely involve hybrid approaches to technology deployment. It is very likely a data center will need both liquid and air cooling orchestrated tightly together to optimize the data center environment. We do very well with that approach with the widest portfolio of thermal technology available, deepest domain expertise on how to orchestrate these technologies using our advanced control systems. Hence over 3,500 field service engineers across the world to support the deployment and maintenance of the infrastructure. We have the scale and the ability to increase capacity. And I hope \u2013 and I believe you can sense my excitement. Much more to come on high density AI at our Investor conference in November, but feel very well positioned for this opportunity. With that, over to David."

                "text": "Perfect. Thanks, Gio. Turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our second quarter financial results. As you can see strong financial performance across the board, starting with [Audio Dip] from last year. 9% of that was from pricing and 16% from volume with most of that volume benefit in the Americas, highlighting the continued supply chain and operational improvements in that region, which has been a pillar of our turnaround over the last 18 months or so. Adjusted operating profit of [Audio Dip] quarter and adjusted operating margin of 14.5% improved 860 basis points of which 610 basis points was from higher variable contribution margin and 250 basis points was from fixed cost leverage. Adjusted operating profit was $61 million higher than our prior guidance. $45 million from higher pricing, $25 million from incremental volume and $15 million from lower than expected inflation with these tailwinds partially offset by headwinds from foreign exchange and investment in fixed costs primarily from restructuring and incentive compensation. Higher than expected pricing was driven by higher volume, favorable regional mix and some conservatism for potential pricing headwinds that did not materialize. Inflation was not as bad as we expected as commodity costs, including metals that declined from the end of the first quarter, likely influenced by a slower than expected rebound in the Chinese economy. Next on this slide and very proudly, we generated $227 million of adjusted free cash flow in the quarter, an impressive $460 million higher than last year\u2019s second quarter. While there\u2019s still a lot of work to do to optimize working capital, our second quarter is reflective of our focus on cash and indicative of the cash generation potential of this business when we do control working capital, which increased just $5 million in the second quarter, despite a $213 million increase in sales from the first quarter. Now, the second quarter number was aided by some favorable timing tailwinds, and we should not expect free cash flow to be 130% of adjusted net income each quarter, but it shows we have made significant strides towards unlocking the cash generation potential of this business, while funding organic growth. Last on this slide, net leverage decline to 3.1x at the end of the quarter and is expected to be approximately 2.3x by year end. Well within our previously communicated target leverage range of 2x to 3x times. It was only a few months ago that we were being labeled by some and likely discounted from a multiple perspective as highly levered. We argued at the time that it was pursuant to a mechanical calculation in just a matter of timing. Well, I think we were proven correct as our year-to-date performance has now driven that mechanical calculation towards what we believe to be the practical reality. Turning to Page 8. This slide summarizes our second quarter segment results. The Americas region continues to show strong year-over-year performance with organic net sales growth of 48%, including 35% from volume and 13% from pricing. Adjusted operating margin improved 12.3 percentage points on the strength of price cost, fixed cost leverage and notably improved operating results from E&I. APAC top line continues to be influenced by slower than expected recovery in China, volume was relatively flat, our organic growth was driven by incremental pricing. Adjusted operating margin declined 100 \u2013 about 100 basis points from last year. And that was primarily driven by approximately $6 million of restructuring costs in the quarter. We do anticipate sequential quarterly sales growth in APAC in the third quarter, but we have reduced our full year projection from our prior guidance now expecting a full year low single digit growth. EMEA grew organically 9% in the second quarter, almost entirely driven by pricing. We expect third quarter sales in EMEA to be down slightly from the second quarter with a significant increase in the fourth quarter and full year growth expected to be in the upper single digits. EMEA continues to impress from an adjusted operating margin perspective, hosting 26.6% for the second quarter, 870 basis points higher than last year with this increase primarily driven by price cost and fixed cost leverage. Finally, on this page, corporate costs were $21 million higher than last year, driven by higher restructuring and incentive compensation costs and an incremental $5 million loss on foreign exchange. Based on the current guidance, we anticipate these incremental costs at our corporate entity to flow through for the full year and we expect second half corporate costs to be consistent with the first half. Next, turning to Page 9. This slide summarizes our third quarter guidance. As a reminder, we have anticipated a more stable quarterly sequential sales cadence as we perceive through 2023. For this reason, our third quarter guidance looks largely consistent with our second quarter in absolute terms. We have included provision for sequential increases in both pricing and inflation in the third quarter and sequential headwinds from foreign exchange, including $15 million on sales and $5 million on adjusted operating profit. Moving to Slide 10 our full year guidance. We are raising our projected top line by $285 million, primarily driven by higher expected sales in the Americas, partially offset by lower expected sales in APAC with EMEA consistent with prior guidance. We are raising our 2023 adjusted operating profit guidance by $150 million, $60 million from the second quarter beat and $90 million in the second half. This increase translates into 170 basis point increase in our expected adjusted operating margin to 14%. And while we have not explicitly provided fourth quarter guidance, math suggests we exit the year at 15% edging closer to our intermediate term target of 16%, which should provide good momentum transitioning into 2024. And finally on this page, we are increasing our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance by $200 million at the midpoint to $550 million. This is an $810 million improvement over last year and demonstrates momentum not only with our drive for profitability, but also with our management of working capital. Before I hand it back over to Gio let me front run some potential questions on our adjusted free cash flow guidance, which implies approximately $300 million of free cash flow in the second half, which is $150 million lower than our second quarter number multiplied by two. The primary driver of this variance is timing. Timing for both CapEx and cash taxes, which are normally back half loaded, and this year is no exception. These two items explain approximately $130 million of the $150 million variance. The remainder is driven by higher use of cash from trade working capital as we prepare for strong anticipated demand in 2024 and that being partially offset by higher projected EBITDA and lower cash interest. So with that said, I turn it back over to Gio."

                "text": "Well, thanks a lot. As Dave said earlier, great quarter, there\u2019s still a lot do. In February \u2013 in our February call, I went through the focus areas for 2023, creating a high performance culture where ownership is clear and we hold ourselves accountable for the results, constant focus on things that matter and executing, relentless focus on execution. At the halfway mark of 2023, we have made progress. Innovation and technology continue to be a key differentiator for Vertiv. And with our ongoing investment in this area, I\u2019m very encouraged by our roadmaps for R&D and technology development. I believe you will see this momentum building and differentiation further distinguished Vertiv as the partner of choice in critical infrastructure. I continue to travel around the globe visiting customers, Vertiv locations and key industry players. I\u2019m more excited today than I have been in the last 25 years with this great organization. I can feel the energy, the momentum building in our business, in our industry. It is tangible. This traction is not easy to translate in words, but you are starting to see the transformation taking hold, deepening and becoming Vertiv\u2019s DNA. So the takeaways. Strong first half supported by continuing improvement in operational execution, a healthy market, momentum continuing, in fact, increasing with AI tailwinds. We are raising our guidance across all financial metrics and especially pleased to be raising our adjusted operating profit guidance to $950 million at the midpoint. This indicates a healthy second half and a great foundation for 2024.

One thing you mentioned Gio was the AI stroke GPU retrofit opportunity. And we don\u2019t often think of retrofit activity in a data center. So just maybe just run through sort of what you\u2019re seeing today and sort of how impactful do you think this could be at Vertiv. And maybe just talk about how important your service organization can be if we do start seeing material retrofits?"
            },
            {
                "speaker": "Giordano Albertazzi",
                "text": "Yes. Two aspects to this Nigel, thank you for the question. There is certainly kind of a non-retrofit, new market, new data center, and it\u2019s a place this one where our service organization becomes absolutely critical in our ability to partner with customers everywhere in the world. Not all the players, specifically the liquid part of the thermal spectrum have this ability to reach out everywhere as we are. And we have demonstrated that. And our numbers prove that as I was saying, 3,500 service engineers globally. But the other is, we see it today and we talk with customers today and they say, not only do we have to think about liquid cooling, but the thing that we have to think about is a hybrid environment to probably in the initial build that has more traditional server cooling. So there needs to be an ability to retrofit over time because sites will hybridize and be enable that and then being there with our customers to execute on that retrofit is, again, fundamental. And that retrofit is not just the rack itself or the row, but is the ability to interconnect and balance it with the rest of the existing thermal system. But think about the stock of data center that exists in the industry today. It\u2019s really hard to believe that that part will not be hybrid in and of itself. And that\u2019s what we hear, that\u2019s what we hear today. Today we hear people saying, hey, we are already today sometimes having AI enabling high density racks and we air cool them, but that sounds easier said than done. Then you have to balance, of course, the cooling in the hole, but at the same time that very same retrofit can be a liquid retrofit eventually. And again, the same problem exists even more complicated, if you will, than with an infrastructure that was thought for future retrofit. Hopefully I answered. Could be very long, I will avoid."

Specifically the comment about EMEA is that we start to see this effect hit EMEA as well. And anyway, we wanted to send the message that we see acceleration on colo/cloud across the board because of AI. How big, exactly? Again, it\u2019s premature to say. The market is moving. I would say it\u2019s hard to distinguish what is AI and what is not, but we know that some technologies, specifically for high-density, specifically for GPU.

Gio, I was hoping you could just talk a little bit more about when it comes to cooling AI clusters, liquid cooling clearly becomes a more important thing, especially in higher densities. But there seems to be multiple ways that you can use liquid cooling, direct-to-chip is something you folks do, but I think there\u2019s immersion and other forms of it. So from your perspective, do you think Vertiv strategy would be to have a broader liquid cooling solution across different formats? Or would you want to focus more on direct-to-chip? And then as it comes \u2013 as it relates to these air clusters, can you just touch on what do you think your economics look like versus the corporate average?"

This is the novelty. This is the new part. As I was saying, actually, there are three ways to make that extraction. A, continue to do it through air. And we have seen air cooled racks going all the way to north of 40 kilowatts per rack density. But clearly, at a certain stage, as one of our slides was explaining, at a certain stage, liquid kicks in. Liquid clicks in form of immersion or direct-to-chip. We have both in our portfolio. And also we\u2019re partnering with people that handle both. But the fact is we think \u2013 we believe that the main technology going forward when it comes to liquid is really direct-to-chip. But again, it is certainly a portfolio approach that we\u2019re taking."

I just wonder if you could update us on all of those levers really, particularly kind of the internal operational opportunities that you see. And I would suspect we\u2019re in a strong enough demand environment that you would expect to be able to remain price cost positive for the foreseeable future, but I wonder if you would agree with that or how are you thinking about kind of the price cost lever inside the margin trajectory from here?"

I mean this is something we\u2019ve been absolutely vocal about in the last three calls, as a matter of fact, this included. Certainly, a lot of price efforts and successful execution, as David explained also our outlook. But what is most important is our price cost. When we were talking about price, I was vocal about the fact that we have now a muscle that we did not have before, and that has helped a lot to rebalance back to position, let\u2019s say, pretty big inflation position. When it comes to the cost side of the equation, we have a lot of focus on efficiency, be that in manufacturing execution, be that in procurement. And there is still potential \u2013 there\u2019s still potential in general. Execution in particular, is true across the organization, across the organization. But I can point particularly to the execution that we have started to drive in the procurement and manufacturing and ability to ship, that has certainly characterized and accelerated our ability to deliver on a strong backlog, we enter 2023 with. So we will have time in November to go to more details of exactly what are the access of this acceleration. But I was vocal about our eternal promotion of Paul and Anders as a further step in the direction that is testament to the fact that we are not done yet. And that\u2019s very good news.

So we kind of say we\u2019re not done in 2023, but we\u2019ve kind of pulled out of the big hole and or something maybe approaching normal, not quite there.

We were probably in the low 30s from a variable contribution margin perspective. We\u2019re in the upper 30s at this point in time, let\u2019s call it, the mid- to upper 30s. So if you look at the projected 600-plus basis point increase in operating margin this year versus last year, about $400 million of that is related to the variable contribution margin; and $200 million is related to fixed cost leverage. And I definitely don\u2019t want to discount the power of the fixed cost constant methodology and culture, that should continue to provide upward momentum on the operating profit. So as we\u2019ve consistently said, 16% has been our intermediate term goal. We have high confidence of getting there for sure, but we\u2019re not celebrating. Our long-term goal is 20% and higher. But to get to that level, Jeff, to your question, we\u2019re going to have to continue to improve with the contribution margin while also incorporating that fixed cost leverage philosophy."

So of that $40 million, probably $30 million of it is in the first half, which provides an actual tailwind as you look at the second half versus the first half. In addition, we do see an uptick in labor inflation, partly because of the timing of pay raises, but also related to a foreign exchange dynamic in Mexico where we have some of our labor.

And do not think necessarily, if I may suggest that it's the exact concatenation of when do I get the chip or the GPU, and when I need the infrastructure because the two things go in parallel and very often, the infrastructure comes first. So you will see probably some earlier infrastructure demand. And when the book or the chips will be available for AI. But it's customer specific.

                "text": "Yes. I think your words, nuts and bolts probably is a pretty good description. We are similar to what we did from an operational perspective, notably in the Americas is we are really getting into the basics and focusing on day-to-day execution. And we have a lot stronger visibility, transparency with where we are with particular payment turns with every customer. We get daily updates as it relates to inventory. And probably most importantly, we have a plan that we are executing against. So I would say there's been some early successes but there still is a ton of opportunity out there. And this is \u2013 was a focus as we exited last year, probably started in force mid last year, but it's also a huge cultural aspect. So when we talk about drumbeat and when we talk about financial metrics, we generally start with cash at this point in time. So we're encouraged with where we are, but not satisfied. There's still a lot of work to do."

The company had been expecting backlog to get worked down a bit this year as lead times normalize. But book-to-bill, as you mentioned, has come in at 1.0, approximately for both 1Q and 2Q. So given the upside in orders you've seen in the first half of the year, can you share your latest views on how you expect backlog to trend? Do you still think that comes down a bit this year? And then on a related topic, given the better than expected demand, do you think you need to put any more manufacturing capacity in place to support that?"

I am very pleased with the results we've delivered in the first quarter and our ongoing progress. Gio's first quarter as CEO is under his belt and his operational focus on delivering results and creating entire performance culture is particularly noticeable, especially in the Americas. We over delivered in the first quarter, compared to guidance and we increased the midpoint of our AOP guidance by 25 million and cash flow was terrific. We entered the year with a very strong backlog. We were able to secure needed tax, and we had capacity in place to deliver a high Q1 sales level. Order rates will be another metric that looks different this year. Gio has some detail in his prepared remarks to explain that. We are constantly focused on the orders rate, and we are encouraged both by the pipeline activity and the pace of investment in our end markets. I've said this for a number of years. There is a true secular growth story at Vertiv. And the work we have done positioning the company for growth and being able to leverage that growth in a meaningful way by getting after margin opportunities, while still protecting growth investment, makes Vertiv uniquely positioned to create substantial value in the years ahead. It is what attracted me to this asset four years ago and I'm even more excited today with the runway ahead. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Gio."

                "text": "Thank you, Dave. Thank you very much and good day everyone. So, we delivered a very strong first quarter sales, up 35% organically led by Americas up over 60%, and EMEA up 25%. We were able to ship more in Q1 than a typical first quarter as we strengthened our supply chain and increased capacity across the world, in particular, in our Monterrey thermal management facility. We had very high backlog starting the year, and we have the capacity to serve the growing demand of the industry. Orders, excluding FX, were down 23% from last year's first quarter. This was in-line with our expectations, driven by the comparison with an exceptionally high Q1 2022 and consistent with the orders normalization trend we referred to in February. Book-to-bill ratio was 1x and backlog remained flat versus year-end 2022, our historical peak. I will further elaborate on this when we review Slide 6. Our adjusted operating profit was $176 million, which was $41 million higher than the top end of our guidance. The beat was largely driven by additional volume and higher than expected variable contribution margin coming from a combination of manufacturing efficiency and supply chain efficiency. We are raising our full-year adjusted operating profit guidance by $25 million at the midpoint, given the strong first quarter results. Adjusted free cash flow was another good story, with $25 million cash generation in the quarter. A $100 million higher than our guidance.  Although pleased with our first quarter performance we know very well there is still work to do. We are holding the adjusted free cash flow guidance for the year at $350 million i.e. the previous mid-point, but we understand there is ample opportunity for improvement and certainly in inventory. We are continuing to strengthen our processes and operational rigor around trade working capital execution. So overall, a good start, and we are squarely focused on delivering the full-year, and that is one quarter at a time. And let us turn to Slide 4. We have no changes to the view on the market from 2 months ago at the end of February. We are cognizant of the headlines around tech and the general uncertainty around macro environment, we continue to see encouraging pipeline activity. Some cloud hyperscale customers are digesting capacity. Others are using this as an opportunity to accelerate their build-outs. Some hyperscalers are moderating CapEx growth, that this moderate growth is still healthy growth. And we see investment continuing. Additionally, we see some market reacceleration in the second half of the year, especially in China, which has been softer over the last several quarters. As Dave mentioned, there is significant secular growth story in our industry. This is further demonstrated by the acceleration of everything artificial intelligence in the tech space.  We are distinctly seeing the first signs of the AI investment cycle in our pipelines and orders. Vertiv is uniquely positioned to win here, given our market leadership and deep domain expertise in areas like thermal management and controls, which are vital to support the complexity of future AI infrastructures. Let's move to Slide 5. First and most importantly, markets are, in general, healthy. Investment continues across markets, hyperscale, colo\u2019s, enterprise. Our project pipeline remains strong. We review pipeline activity regularly and diligently, and pipeline activity remains encouraging. First quarter orders, including the impact of foreign exchange, declined 23%. There are other dynamics that are important to unfold. So, we have provided additional details in the next slide. More comments then. Let me go back to the investments in AI. You may have heard it as generally characterized as the next infrastructure arms race, Vertiv benefits from this race and is an agnostic partner of choice to the risk participants. The acceleration in investment in AI will turn into a net infrastructure capacity demand acceleration, and this starts to be visible in our pipeline. AI applications\u2019 demand and net capacity increase in the industry, higher power density, a gradual migration to an air and liquid hybrid cooling environment and a transition to liquid-ready facility designed. I do not believe there is anyone else in the data center infrastructure space as well positioned as Vertiv even our expertise through technology portfolio, infrastructure system view and advanced control systems. Already today, some AI infrastructure orders are in our backlog, and we are encouraged by the potential that AI represents for Vertiv. So supply chain, it is incrementally better. There are still pockets of tightness in electronics, but the relentless qualification of additional suppliers we have driven in the last 12 months is helping us a lot. Inflation. We anticipate metal cost at lower levels in 2023 versus 2022, although they are starting to trend upwards, a more favorable environment on freight, reduced spot buy activity that both trending back to historic levels and that are good offset. I also like to remind that we have built up a robust pricing process that helps us in case of enduring inflation. Any overall price cost is developing according to plan and consistent with expectations. Let's now move to Slide 6. Let me here elaborate on future Q1 orders, order normalization and lead times. Indeed, last year's Q1 poses an exceptionally challenging comparison with orders up 34% from the first quarter of 2021. We will see some quarter-to-quarter variation due to timing of large projects, but last year's first quarter was exceptionally in that sense. We believe order normalization is very real. We talked about this in February 2022. In 2022, the large hyperscale and colocation customers were giving us orders that covered their requirements for extended period. As I mentioned, some going out 18-plus months due to the challenging supply chain and lead time situation in the industry. They wanted to secure the capacity they needed long-term. That behavior was particularly pronounced in our thermal line of business. Now that our lead times are improving, not yet where we want them to be, but much better than last year. We anticipate they will continue to improve going forward. Now that our lead times are improving, I would say, customers are more comfortable releasing orders at a much more normal cadence. This creates short-term air pocket, but does not impact the volume or timing of what we will ultimately ship to customers. Order patterns are just normalizing. This is healthy for our business and the industry. So what does that leave us? We are encouraged that our book-to-bill ratio is at 1x. And our backlog remains at the same level we had at the end of 2022, even with an extremely strong shipment quarter in where organic sales were increased 35%. Worth signaling an approximately 12% 3-year order CAGR that reflects good end market demand. We believe that Q1 2023 will remain the most unfavorable year-over-year quarterly comparison in 2023, we believe it improves from here. We still anticipate a reduction in Q2 2023 orders versus prior year, but improving relative to Q1. It is hard to have a crystal ball into second half of 2023. But with what I hear from customers, including what seems to be reforming into a substantial investment cycle for AI, I remain optimistic that year-over-year orders will turn positive when we get to later quarters. Having said that, I'll pass it over to David, who will walk us through the financials. Over to you, David."

                "text": "Perfect. Thanks, Gio. Turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our first quarter financial results. As you can see, we exceeded the high end of guidance for all metrics on this slide, starting with sales, which were up organically $405 million or 35% from last year's first quarter. The 105 million of this increase was from pricing and 300 million from volume, which was up approximately $100 million versus what we assumed in guidance. A vast majority of this volume increase was based in the Americas as we continue to see significant improvements in supply chain and manufacturing efficiency and the two are related in that region. And it all starts with and is supported by a sound SIOP process. Adjusted operating profit of $176 million, was $163 million higher than last year's first quarter and $41 million higher than the top end of guidance, and this was primarily due to volume leverage and a higher contribution margin percentage driven by the improved manufacturing efficiency in our North American plants as once again, supply chain issues continue to be addressed and process improvements take hold. Of note at the very bottom of the second gray box at the bottom of this page, we recognized a $13 million charge for restructuring in the quarter, and you can see that on the face of our income statement. In the spirit of winning now and winning later, while we continuously invest in productivity and efficiency projects, we will overdrive these investments when opportunities present themselves. Well, in the first quarter, an $8 million onetime gain related to the reversal of an indemnification claim pursuant to the Emerson carve-out provided that opportunity. Instead of dropping this gain to the bottom line, we accelerated restructuring projects costing $13 million, which should drive $20 million of annualized savings, some of which should benefit the later part of 2023. Once again, winning now and winning later. Moving to the right on this slide, adjusted free cash flow of $25 million was $175 million higher than last year and $100 million better than the midpoint of guidance. Improvement versus both last year and guidance was driven by higher adjusted operating profit and significant progress in driving advanced payments from customers. As Gio mentioned, while there is still work to do across all trade working capital categories, we are pleased with the results for the first quarter, and we anticipate continued improvement going forward. Finally, on this slide, if you look at the bottom right-hand corner of that last box, we exited the first quarter with a net debt leverage ratio of approximately 4.3x and that was down from 5.5x at year-end. While net debt did not significantly change our trailing 12-month adjusted operating profit increased approximately 163 million from year-end as the $13 million from the first quarter of last year was replaced by the $176 million this year. As we reminded folks in February, although mechanical leverage calculations might have [wrote] [ph] and one could say maybe even lazily classified us as higher leverage. We do not believe that was consistent with the underlying reality but more a product of timing in our challenged first half of 2022. Based upon our updated guidance, we expect to be between 3.5x and 4x after the second quarter and approximately 3x at year-end, which is at the top end of our 2x to 3x long-term target range. Next, turning to Page 8. This slide summarizes our first quarter segment results. The Americas region had year-over-year organic sales growth of 61%, and that's not a typo, including volume of 48% and pricing of 13%. Americas entered the year with a very strong backlog and with improvements in the SIOP process and the supply chain, coupled with the continued capacity ramp-up in our new thermal facility in Monterrey, we were able to drive significant top line volume growth. EMEA also benefiting from a strong backlog, posted organic growth of 26%, including 17% from volume and 9% from pricing. APAC is somewhat an outlier compared to the other 2 regions for the first quarter. While we had good growth in India and Southeast Asia, China continued to be impacted by the effects of the post-COVID recovery and related project pushouts for the second quarter and back half of the year. Based upon our visibility to an improving pipeline driven by the anticipated macroeconomic recovery and government-sponsored actions that should benefit data centers, we remain optimistic, anticipating mid-to-upper single-digit organic growth in APAC for 2023 and good momentum heading into 2024. At the bottom of the slide, Americas continued its momentum from the second half of 2022 with adjusted operating margin of 22.1%, 11.3 percentage points higher than last year's first quarter and 160 basis points better than the fourth quarter. About half of the improvement was driven by higher variable contribution margin, including a significant price/cost benefit with the other half from fixed cost leverage as we continue to drive our fixed cost constant philosophy, while investing in capacity and technology. EMEA adjusted operating margin also improved nicely from last year's first quarter by over 700 basis points, with about half of that improvement from fixed cost leverage. Finally, APAC, their adjusted operating margin, like its top line remained relatively flat from last year. Turning to Page 9. This slide summarizes our second quarter guidance. As we mentioned in our press release, due to our strong beginning of the year backlog and an improved supply chain, we anticipate quarterly seasonality to look a bit different in 2023 compared with historic patterns. As a result, we are not projecting as a significant incremental jump in top line from the first quarter to the second quarter, like prior years, and we should see a more uniform quarterly sales pattern, albeit increasing as we sequentially move through 2023. For the second quarter, we anticipate organic sales growth of 15%, with 9% from volume and 6% from pricing. We are projecting adjusted operating profit of $190 million at the midpoint, with pricing, volume, and productivity benefits partially offset by inflation and growth investments with the resulting adjusted operating margin up 600 basis points from prior year.  We have not provided adjusted free cash flow guidance for the second quarter, but we expect positive cash flow in each of the remaining quarters with sequential increases, and we reiterate our full-year guidance on the next slide, which is a good segue moving to the next slide, Slide 10, where we summarize our full-year guidance. We have raised our, as Gio mentioned, we have raised our 2023 adjusted operating profit guidance by $25 million at the midpoint, building on our strong first quarter performance. Although we experienced favorable supply chain dynamics in the first quarter, there remains uncertainty in certain pockets of our procurement, including notably power semiconductors.  So, we are approaching volume estimates for the rest of the year with caution. This may be perceived as conservatism, but we believe it is the prudent approach at this point based upon the supply chain volatility we have all seen in the last 18 months, as we know, things can change quickly. We are guiding full-year adjusted operating margin of 12.3% as we continue our progress towards an anticipated 16% in the intermediate term and 20% in the long-term. And as I mentioned, we are reiterating our adjusted free cash flow guidance for the full-year of $350 million at the midpoint. With that said, I turn it back over to Gio."

Gio, could you give us a little more color into your end markets and elaborate on your comments that you think orders could turn positive later this year? I think some investors are probably surprised that cloud and colocation markets in the Americas have hung in as well as they have. So, maybe more specific color on those markets? And then how much of the incremental orders or pipeline that you see or would you say more AI focused? And what gives you the confidence that China is going to come back in the second half of the year?"

                "text": "Okay. Well, thank you for your question, Andy. I would say that many elements for this confidence. One is what we see in the pipelines and pipelines are moving, we are definitely pleased by our book-to-bill ratio at one, as we were saying, especially given the overage in sales relative to Q1 guidance. But as we said, the \u2013 especially the hyperscalers and not stopping their investment. We also heard some prominent hyperscalers in the last few days, sending messages about their infrastructure spend. So, there is positivity in the air. And again, that results with what we see in the pipeline. Now, we talked last time about normalization, and that's what we continue to see. So, do not be surprised when we will see still the second quarter that on a competitive basis will be down year-on-year, but up in absolute terms versus Q1 as we were saying. But again, there is movement out there. There is a positivity. Now, not all the hyperscalers are exactly in the same place or all the colos are in the same place, but many of the large ones are \u2013 continues to plan capacity expansion. It is difficult to your point about AI. It's difficult to really draw a line between AI investment, enabling investment and other investments. I would say that the line is blurring. One would think that AI is a totally new thing. Certainly, generative AI is accelerating very rapidly. But there are elements in AI and everything we do today already. So, if anything, we see an acceleration not a sharp transition to something completely new. But we see AI in terms of the type of conversations and specifications that we see coming our way. And again, as I'm saying, when going through the slides, a lot about power density, and a lot about bigger capacity investments, kind of bigger chunks and that's encouraging. So again, AI as a transition and I invite everyone to think AI more in terms of a transition towards a higher density, higher density compute and high-density power as a consequence. You were asking about China. We believe China will reaccelerate in the second half. The best indicator \u2013 two indicators. That's what we see in other markets, other industries than China in general is an economy say in and trending towards, but also we see it quite clearly in our pipeline. Our pipelines are strongly accelerating in China. Hope I answered your question."

But I would say that when we look at is really a combination of a better AOP, better profit certainly help, and the other are kind of our payments, advanced payments that helped. We know that we have work to do on the trade working capital and we are focusing on that. For us, that means concentrating, especially on inventory and for us, inventory reduction and inventory optimization means working intensely on supplier lead time reduction, execution in everything that is a [sign] [ph] of material planning, material management production planning. Vendor management in general, we are activating a lot of vendor-managed inventory agreements, all things that will go in the direction of shortening the cycle. As the cycle shortens our inventory go down, I was talking about supply chain resiliency, that's a big element. Supply performance is a big element because we can reduce our safety stock without impacting our service level, et cetera. So, it's a system. It's an array of actions. And I think that touched upon the most important. David, anything else to add? Of course, it's not just inventory. There are many facets."

Absolutely not perfect yet, as I was saying. But very, very importantly, in availability of capacity that we did not have before. So, we have more capacity now than we had in the past and certainly a lot more capacity to serve an industry that needs capacity. We, in the Americas have done \u2013 we have approached the improvements in the Americas in many, many angles, alignment, talent, leadership capacity processes, fixed supply chain, a lot of price, price, price, but we continue to have a strong backlog also in the Americas. Now, comparatives will be a little bit more challenging, but we continue to see growth for the rest of the year. So, the strength of the first quarter was not a fluke.

And thinking that all the high density will be grant new into an existing data center infrastructure, which certainly happened. But it's solely happening in that dimension. No. We believe that the opportunity for retrofit will be there, a bit premature, I must say. But one thing I'm sure we are extremely well-positioned there, a, because in the existing stock of data center globally, we have a big installed base. So, no one better than current vendor can help you transition to the new technology, but also again, because if you think about our global presence of service domain knowledge. And one thing that is interesting, as I alluded to, probably a little bit too rapidly in \u2013 when we're going through the slides is that, when I talk to them, to our customers, rarely do they think binary in terms, Oh it's all AI, oh, it's all \u2013 the new infrastructure is all very high density. The most think about an infrastructure that needs to be resilient over time and enable a transition of technology they probably last 10 years.

And when we look at our backlog and run the numbers versus last year, they're coming up higher. And we continue to be successful with our new pricing. I think the incremental [25] [ph] came from a recalculation of the carryover, but the big thing with the pricing is it's not turning the other way. So, the pricing in the market certainly in the Americas and EMEA, it's sticking, and we're continue to be out there, and we think we're kind of at the right price point, but we'll continue to push it a little bit."

A lot of companies in my group kind of operate in the 60% range or so. So, how do we kind of get that conversion relative to your EBITDA higher? Are there any things in particular that need to happen? I think working capital is probably a big chunk of it, but maybe you could bridge us to potential improvement in the out years on that metric?"

That's very dependent upon growth because trade working capital is the biggest drag. So, I think if you look at the metric based on 2023, and you have to look at adjusted net income, it's probably [75%] [ph]. The two biggest drags versus getting to [100] [ph] is working capital. And then also, we're over investing this year with CapEx.  So, our depreciation, if you include software amortization is probably close to $90 million, $95 million, but we have $140 million of CapEx a lot of that, which is supporting additional capacity. So, in the long run, that has to stabilize just mathematically. So that will probably close maybe a little less than half of that gap. But in the long run, your point is absolutely right on. It has to be work with working capital. And we made some progress here in the first quarter, and we project that, that will continue to make progress over the rest of the year. But in the long run, to hit that target, we're going to have to continue to optimize inventory and balance out AR and AP."

And anything you would call out in terms of cancellations, something would be really helpful. And then separately, Gio, I'm hoping you could talk a little bit on this AI dynamic. A lot of the hyperscale companies, I think, at this point are debating if they want to do 100% immersion liquid cooling or hybrid cooling. Do you think your value proposition is as attractive in the immersion liquid cooling market as it's on the hybrid side? Thank you."

But let's go back to February, when we're saying we are entering 2022 with more than 70% backlog coverage, and that's not normal. We still believe that is the case. I mean if you go back to whatever the normal would be, we would be probably on a 50% or below 50% backlog coverage. So, I'd like to think in terms of percent, not necessarily absolute number. So probably when we go into 2024, we will be more on \u2013 we will be \u2013 most likely we will be in a lower coverage than the 70% we saw last year. Now it's a little bit premature really to say how everything will pan out. But think in terms of a lower backlog coverage going forward.  Again, that's normal. We talked about lead times. We talked about the reduction of lead time and with the reduction of lead time and the levels of backlog coverage that we had at the beginning of 2023 are incompatible. So simply, the industry will adjust again. Clearly, a lot of the revenue in 2023 comes from backlog conversion, but that's just in the math, in the numbers. But you're talking about cancellations. Nothing out of the ordinary. And let me talk about cooling technology. As I said earlier, it will be a hybrid world from a cooling technology standpoint and the degree of the mix between traditional and liquid will probably change over time very, very small percent of liquid at the beginning and then increasing in the next years, I would say, certainly not months. Yes. You're talking about immersion cooling, immersion is just one of the liquid cooling technologies. There are a lot of our technologies that in this moment, are competing in a technology landscape that is not mature yet. And we are working with some of the biggest hyperscalers and some of the biggest chip manufacturers to really make sure that we align our technology to their evolution and we make sure that we enable they're scaling their solutions out in the market."

And it's something that we have embedded in the process. So, we're very optimistic that, that will continue. But to embed that into the guidance, we're going to wait for three months another quarter to, kind of reassess that. As it relates to individual quarterly guidance for free cash flow, I think historically, we have not provided that we did last year. We are not doing that just because of the lumpiness and some of the variability around free cash flow for individual quarters. As we mentioned in the past, we have $40 million to $50 million check runs that could go out one day versus the next and swing a quarter. So, I wouldn't read much into that. We're still very confident with the free cash flow program. We do anticipate it to sequentially increase as we move through the year and we'll reassess that guidance as we get to the end of the second quarter."
