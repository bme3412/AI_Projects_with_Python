"""
Quarterback (QB):
    - **"The Sophomore Surge"**: QBs in their second year as a starter tend to outperform expectations due to increased comfort with the system and improved chemistry with receivers.
    - **"Stability Breeds Success"**: QBs who have had the same offensive coordinator for 3+ years tend to perform better than those in new systems.
    - **"The Comeback King"**: QBs coming off a down year (where they played but underperformed) tend to bounce back and provide good value in the following season.
    - **"The Late Season Surge"**: QBs who perform well in the final quarter of the previous season often carry that momentum into the next season.
    - **"The Mobile Advantage"**: QBs who add significant rushing yards to their passing stats are more consistent scorers, providing a safer floor each week.

Tight End (TE):
    - **"The QB's Best Friend"**: TEs who have been with the same QB for 2+ years tend to see more targets and have better production, especially in the red zone.
    - **"Late Bloomer"**: TEs often take 2-3 years to develop in the NFL, so third-year TEs could be poised for a breakout.
    - **"System Matters"**: TEs in offenses that historically target the position frequently (e.g., certain coaches or schemes) are more likely to outperform their draft position.
    - **"The Red Zone Threat"**: TEs who lead their team in red zone targets tend to have higher touchdown potential, making them valuable even with lower yardage.
    - **"The Consistency Factor"**: TEs with a steady target share week-to-week offer a reliable floor, reducing the risk of boom-or-bust performances.

Running Back (RB):
    - **"The Workhorse Theory"**: RBs on teams with few viable backups tend to outperform their ADP due to guaranteed volume.
    - **"O-Line Correlation"**: RBs behind top-10 ranked offensive lines (based on previous year's performance) tend to outperform their draft position.
    - **"The Contract Year Bump"**: RBs in the final year of their rookie contract tend to see increased usage and production as they play for their next contract.
    - **"The Pass-Catching Specialist"**: RBs who are heavily involved in the passing game (e.g., 50+ receptions) offer added value in PPR (Points Per Reception) leagues.
    - **"The Goal-Line Grinder"**: RBs who dominate goal-line carries on their team have a higher likelihood of scoring touchdowns, boosting their weekly value.

Wide Receiver (WR):
    - **"The Target Hog"**: WRs who were top-10 in targets the previous year but outside the top-20 in touchdowns are likely to see positive touchdown regression.
    - **"The Scheme Fit"**: WRs who move to teams with offensive schemes that match their strengths (e.g., deep threat to a team with a strong-armed QB) tend to outperform expectations.
    - **"The QB Upgrade"**: WRs who get a significant QB upgrade in the offseason (e.g., from a bottom-10 to top-10 QB) tend to outperform their previous year's stats.
    - **"The Volume Spike"**: WRs who see an increase in targets due to a teammate's injury or departure often see a significant boost in fantasy production.
    - **"The Slot Specialist"**: WRs who primarily line up in the slot and face softer coverage from opposing defenses can rack up consistent catches and yardage, especially in PPR leagues.
